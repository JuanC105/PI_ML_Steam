Firstly, graphically speaking, it is a gorgeous looking game and it runs at a consistent 60FPS. The game may look like a Super Mario Galaxy Knockoff, and the developer of this game has admitted to that, but personnally, I didn't think it was a bad choice for level design. Control wise, its easy to move sonic about and being able to home in on multiple enemies with the homing attack is certainly satisfying, but the game does have a hard time teaching you how to use its Parkour feature and the game can feel clunky at times. When you get the hang of it, the parkour can be a welcoming new gameplay feature to the Sonic franchise, and I think they should keep it for potential future Sonic titles. I find it strange that Sonic's natural abilitie to run around is mapped to the right bumper of my controller, does Sonic just not have the natural ability to sprint around naturally anymore? However, I do love the welcoming return of the Spindash, that little baby is still rocking my world, although I do wish it lasted longer that 2 seconds after charging it.Be warned, this game starts off simple and easy for you too grasp the basics of how things work, but slowly and surely, the game with put you to the test. This game will frustrate you if you are not patient enough to endure a lot of trial and error, levels will get harder, crazy gameplay elements will be thrown at you from all directions and you are most likely going to die a lot, so rack up on those lives, because this game is not going to show you any mercy. Also, don't feel surprised if you feel like the games many gameplay elements consist of strange activities, such as guiding fruits to blenders, because believe me, the game will eventually reveal itself to have levels built specifically for experimentation and player feedback.The music is definetly something to behold, wonderfully composed with a lot of great orchestration, rock and occasional heavy metal. Though I do wish Crush 40 or Cash Cash came in to do a song like they've done in the past, I guess their contract with Sonic games is over. :/Now, the one thing I hear people complain about constantly is the story, and yeah, it isn't overly complex or enjoyably silly as say, Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colours, but with what the game presents us graphically with its simple yet beautiful designed with a simple Sonic must defeat Eggman/ The Deadly Six plot, I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The Deadly Six as characters, I don't hate them, they're just not that interesting, although Zazz cracks me up with every line he says.Overall, even though I haven't completed the game, while I find that the game does reek of experimentation and they're are some issues with the controls, I had a fun time with this game. Its is not perfect by any means, and for people who can't get into this based on the level design and the controls, I don't blame you, you probably don't have as much patience with games as much as I do.Approach this game with caution my fellow gamers, if you found this review helpful, I'm happy to have given my thoughts on it. Have fun and have a Good night :)""}]",['329440'],['2'],[True],1.0

I played this game originally on the 3DS and when this game is going to be released on Steam, I was confused, but mostly excited. I played this game for countless of hours not due to the RPG or the battle mechanics, but rather the Visual Novel-esc gameplay with the Female characters. Learning about their backstory, struggles and quirks, it is a pretty interesting ride. However, the battle mechanics is what caused the game to be okay. The battle system does drag as it is repetitive and gets stale fast. It is interesting in concept such as the position of the characters and chaining but battles can be easily be won by using the auto command. I know this is a dungeon crawler type game but the aesthetics of the labyrinth looks unappealing and not that interesting. And yet, I still continue on playing. Because of wanting to know more of the characters and learn how they progress, I continue to slog through the labyrinth just to see what happens next with the characters. I know at points the characters have the personality of your typical anime but I am a sucker for romance and Conception II is no exception.Now to talk about the port. The port is pretty good. 60 fps, better visual graphics and the ability to change the voice between Japanese and English is a nice addition. Also all the DLCs, from what I read, will all be in the Steam edition pre-packed which is nice. Overall the port clearly have some effort put in and not just dump it from the 3DS or Vita version. Overall, I would say Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars is an okay game. If you were to treat this game more of a Visual Novel such as I did, you will have a much better time though be mindful of the repetitive battle system.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted June 13.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '468410', 'helpful': '1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'When I first bought the Sydney Character Pack, I thought the Anarchist Perk Deck is terrible. Slow regen rate, Easily downed by a sniper and low health while wearing the ICTV. First Impression of the perk deck is pretty meh. However, with the suit build up and the introduction of the skill revamp, it become my main perk deck. With the amount of armor, especially with the skill to increase regen by headshotting and overall armor, this perk deck is incredibly fun to use. Being in constant firefight with no worries to go out of the heat for your armor to regen is the best. It could manage to create your suit into a base ICTV while also having fast movement speed.The Bootleg Assault Refile is not the best assault refile but it is still fun to use. Having amount of ammo in your megazine and spraying it everywhere is neat. Butterfly knife is not a really good melee weapon due to poor stats in favour for butterfly knife tricks animation, Though i still bring it to loud heist because it is interesting to look at the knife animation while waiting for the drill to finish.Lastly, the bulk of the character pack is Sydney herself, Yes she can be annoying at times. The amount of ""Sit on a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• [Insert Enemy Special Here]"" can be repetitive at times while also abit screechy. But I still love it anyway. The tattoos on the arms with fingerless leather gloves is pretty to look at. She been my main since the release of the DLC.On the whole, while this DLC is not the most essential DLC in Payday 2 but it is incredibly worth it just for the perk deck alone.'}]","['458730', '468410']","['2', '2']","[True, True]",1.0

It's terrifyingly scary, but not at all in a cheap way. Some moments will have you holding your breath (ha) in suspense; listening for any alien sounds or distant figures in the depths below.The gameplay aspect of Subnautica is astounding. When playing it for the first time, it seems very intimidating (I guess I've got a bit of a fear for the deep ocean, and was playing completely blind, which I highly recommend!), but as you explore more and more, you're introduced to new biomes, and every time you push yourself to go deeper and further from the starting location, you gain access to awesome and exciting new equipment and tools. Better weapons/deterrents, different modes of transport, all of which in turn allow you to explore deeper and further yet again.One thing to watch out for however - the game is stil in early access, and I've encountered a few inevitable bugs, nothing gamebreaking. Remember to save your game often and report any bugs, just in case you fall through the floor of your seabase or something. Also, I don't recommend building around the edges of the map, as with some updates the devs add new biomes, which may delete any previous structures in those areas.Anyhow, in my opinion Subnautica is definitely worth the $20, and is high up in my all-time favourites.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '72850', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""The fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls series is the epitome of open-world games, with just so much to do! You can explore for all the time you want, and become immersed in the beauty of the landscape, admiring the commendable amount of detail put into the game by Bethesda. Just about every single NPC has or is involved with one or more quests for the player, and every one of these quests is unique and interesting, most of the time giving the player a surprise near the end. It's shocking to see some NPC you see everyday like the local shopkeeper turn out to be some dark cultist, or mythical creature, or something else equally horrifying.Many times during gameplay I have stumbled upon sidequests, only to completely abandon my main quest at the time and continue with said sidequest, and in turn discover more and more quests to complete. At the moment, I still have an extensive list of quests to complete, and even though i've finished the main storyline, the game is not nearly over yet, and I will most likely pour hundreds of hours into it in order to complete these sidequests.Even if you do manage to complete the game, workshop support basically enables you to download addons such as new weapons, NPC's, and quests, as well as tweaks that affect things such as lighting, gameplay/combat style, and even things such as weather and temperature effects on the player, making the game easier or harder.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in RPG games, and even if you're not quite into them, it's still great fun to be had.Oh yeah, and also, uh...dragons.

It read, 'GamezBro is now playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.' Sebly listened to Gamez as he played Counter-Strike for the first time. Sebly did this for the rest of the day. The next day he listened again. This happened for many days, until it was unbearable. Sebly bought the game. As it installed, Sebly impatiently sat at his computer, as he listened to GamezBro getting owned in a Team Deathmatch. Finally the download was finished. Sebly booted up the game. He started the tutorial (as he always did) and was mid-way through it when he had to go. Sebly miserably shut down his computer.Ok. Now onto the actual review. CS:GO is great. Easy to play, hard to Master. The game is very simple. Terrorists versus Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorists must plant the bomb at either the A or B bombsites, and the Counter-Terrorists must stop them. It feels great to rush into B on Dust II and plant the bomb, or to AWP someone through mid-doors. But the best feeling comes when you: Headshot someone from far away with and AK. Get 2 or more kills with a single bullet. Watch the CTs run around looking for the strategically placed bomb.  Get 2 knife kills in a row etc. There's a different feeling when you trade one of the many skins that are available in the game. The item system in the game is genius. You can find gun skins or weapons crates (which can be unlocked with a key), after a game is finished, which you can then trade. You can even put stickers on the guns :D.This game is a must-have. If you dont have it get it. 1000/10Thx for reading.

Between lenient system requirements, a solid (albeit imbalanced, at times) combat system, a funky-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• broad permittizzle fo' exploration n' a wide selection of buildin decor, itz tha type of game dat strikes me as havin suttin' fo' everyone. Which is good, when you consider dat it also has multiplayer n' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Even mo' betta when you git ta tha late game, which has a wide array of weapons, armors n' tools ta allow fo' a wide variety of specializations.Buildin n' exploration is phat points up in favor of tha game yo, but tha gameplay mechanics is suttin' I'd like ta single up fo' praise. For a 2D game, its combat system has a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of spectacle, n' like thatz part of why I find it so charmin yo. Hurtin enemies--even dem playas whoz ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is vastly inferior ta you--feels good. Y'all KNOW dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! It aint nuthin but satisfyin ta hear tha hit sound on tha mo' squishy enemies, n' peep dem explode tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• into fine lil chunks when they take a thugged-out dirt nap. Ground movement could be mo' betta yo, but certain late game ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hit you wit tha mobilitizzle ta dash n' fly, which straight-up expand how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you can explore n' fight fo' realz. And wit a wide selection of weapons, every last mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in playa is bound ta find a rosta of tools, spells n' fish-related artillery dat fits they playstyle.Da game aint without flaws, mind yo thugged-out ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. With tha gamez update history, tha launch endgame now vastly differs from dat of tha current one. This has hustled ta some balizzle n' progression issues, da most thugged-out glarin of which bein how tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• sluggish tha early game feels. Well shiiiit, it worries me dat tha start of tha game might dissuade some playas from playing, when they might ludd what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tha late game has ta offer n' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Da game also has a wack g-thang of recyclin mob AI wit reskins, though dis be averted by adjustin certain parametas n' givin dem unique abilitizzles ta hide tha fact. Even though I have mo' ta say bout tha shortcomings, there be a just too much phat up in tha game ta stay mad bout what tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• effectively boils down ta nitpicking.Plus, it has hats fo' realz. Any game dat has a selection of basebizzle caps gets brownie points.Watch some trailers. Read some other props. If dis be lookin like suttin' you'd be interested in, then take it from me: give Terraria a cold-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• lil chance. Da game occasionally goes on sale fo' 75% off, so pick up a gangbangin' four pack fo' yo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• n' three playas. If I be wrong, then I cost you a meal at Subway--not subliminal advertising--and I be sorry as a mutha‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a bout dat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. But if I be right, then it'll be well worth tha price. We sposed ta ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in pay $60 these minutes fo' a gangbangin' fulfillin gamin experience. This is one that'll run you $10, at most.

Unfortunately fo\' tha Terrorists, they is dumb n\' only packed one bomb.

Da Counter-Terrorists done been deployed ta save one, not both, of tha hostages. In reality, dis is just a thinly-veiled excuse fo\' tha CTs ta cappin\' tha Terrorists while pumpin roundz tha ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• into tha invincible hostages. One weird thang bout hostage maps is dat you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow make gives you tha mobilitizzle ta put a grown playa on yo\' shouldaz up in a second.

After manually researching, you decide you should automate Science. (At this point let's say we have electricity) After auto research, a biter attack happens. You only have a gun to protect yourself as a gun turret is still being built. You then defend your base, and automate more science. 10-30 hours later, you are already building a rocket silo, where you finish the game. You then decide to install mods, where you go all over again with a new experience.

This game, when I first played it in early beta, had little to nothing to do. I literally just farmed exp until I got to the highest level, then stopped playing for 3 months. Now however it has way more stuff to do, like a wider variety of missions, open world events and (finally) a campaign.Pros: A good enough variety of missions to keep you entertained for quite some time.A cool way to get resources, where you have to defend a thumper while enemies attempt to destroy it.The Chosen can attack ad take over outposts, and sometimes have an invasion in a major city, which causes it to be engulfed by the Melding. (Storyline stuff, watch the game intro)Lots of different battleframes for players to choose from to satify their fighting style.Rewards players for helping each other, even when not grouped together.Rewards for doing specific challenges, like open world exploration.Cons: Map isn\'t small, but it wouldn\'t hurt to make it bigger.LGVs or the mounts used ingame are unavailable for crafting unless you hit lvl 40 (max level) or you buy one from the store.Short campaign (Is being worked on though ;D)When you finish the campaign it doesn\'t take too long before you find a repetitive cycle between missions.Character depth goes about as deep as lines like, ""I feel like we can do more, WE HAVE TO DO MORE!"" (Feel the emotion)Overall I would recommend this game because even though the missions are a bit lacking there is still plenty of things to do and places to explore, also by getting friends on, you form a squad and try the new Hardcore mode out for campaign.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted February 25, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '328500', 'helpful': '2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '11/10 Would Seek Troof Again.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 30, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '8190', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Stupidly fun.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can\'t really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 25, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited March 17.', 'item_id': '252950', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Great banter has been had while playing this game. 10/10 would play again.BTW ONLY PLAY WITH CONTROLLLER PC CONTROLS ARE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•'}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted May 4.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '318420', 'helpful': '1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power.

For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun.

Even though it\'s over 5 years old, This game holds up alongside the ranks of Half Life, Assasins Creed and, you guessed it, the Elder Scrolls games. Developed by the same people who later brought you skyrim, and previously, oblivion, This game is a brilliant and addictive game. And no, It\'s not broken for windows 7 or 8. There are many community guides you can look up to make this game run on those operating systems. The fix is easy and the game and the minimal trouble to get it working are both very much worth it, This game is inspirational, And though there are a couple of bugs and glitches, There are many community modders and patches that have been released on nexus. This game has a reasonably active modding community and an easy, open third-party program called FOMM (Fallout Mod Manager) that has all the basic tools for modding the game, There\'s not multiplayer, But you dont really need it, Its fun enough as it is, So you dont have to worry about being banned by people for bad ping and listening to a chat full of screemers. This game does one thing right, and that\'s singleplayer. I think of this games mechanics like skyrim, But with guns, radiations and tales of the post cold-war wastelands as humanity struggles to survive.So, A recap:Pro\'s:- Your choices actually matter.- You are given many options in combat, and can even recruit bodygaurds.- You feel the atmosphere of the wastes greeting you.- The story is brilliantly written.- The voice acting is damn good (in most cases).- Many modding options.- The G.O.T.Y. edition here gives you all 5 dlc at once.- Great, Helpful community.- Allot of side quests and places to explore, Playing Endgame after the main storyline is still exciting and challenging.Con\'s:- Needs fixing for Win 7&8 which Bethesda denied. (can still be fixed manually).- No multiplayer, It\'s a single player only game, Like skyrim.- Combat ADS doesnt ""Aim Down Sights"" but rather zooms in a little, Except on scoped weapons.- Textures aren\'t the best, Though this can be fixed with a couple of simple mods.- Lots of little bugs, a couple of game breaking ones.- Earning money is nigh, frustrating at the beginning.- The crappy green tint filter gets annoying after a while, Though, there is a mod to remove the tint.All in all, I give it 101/10'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 2, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '333950', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Now, Don't mistake this game to be anything like space engineers, The people over at Keen have done an amazing job at making this game vary from space engineers, Those of you who have Space Engineers will have to re-think everything you thought you knew about engineering. The Physics complexity, The Graphical beauty and the absolutely stunning soundtrack make this game completely worth the cost! The soundtrack alone is worth buying this game!The downside's are that the game so far has not been completed, so flaws are to be expected, and the structural integrity can crash the game at some point and because it's newer there's a distinct lack of mod's compared to its space-themed counterpart.To sum it all up;Pro's:+Graphically stunning, very good for an alpha, But atleast on my PC, Not too taxing.+Eargasm! The soundtrack is both soothing, and uplifting. If you like medieval themed orchestra, Then the music alone is reason enough to buy this game!+Complex physics.  Something that is hardly ever seen in most games is the formation of rubble in such a believable manner. Your building's will have to stand up to the test of gravity and it really makes you need to think outside the box!+Scroll n' roll. Scrolling with select blocks will give you varients of that block type. This is something i love about Medieval Engineers. Nuff said.+Blockception. You can place a block withing a block withing a block within a bl- (etc.)Con's:-Physics! Y U DO THIS?! Like I said, Amazingly complex and glorious physics and destruction, But these attributes are also a downfall if you build too big! The very structural integrity this game is heralded for is its greatest downfall, requiring you to bear with the limitations of the current engine. Remember, This will probably be changed in later updates.-So, No real weapons? Well, Not yet. You can shoot canonballs but let's be honest. We're all waiting for swords, shields, bows and arrows! The recent addition of Barbarians (destructive A.I.) can't be killed very easily and appear to have their own spiked club as a weapon, which is not available to the player at this time. This will mostlikely change in future updates.Now there are probably some other things, but that's a summary. Also, some blocks are missing from the trailer, My guess is over at Keen, They are fixing up some block dynamics, Checking viability and tweaking the physics engine a bit. The lack of mod's in the steam workshop should be temporary too, as the more people get this, the more modder's will come and grace this gem of a game. You dont even need to own this game to mod it! :DIn the end, I give it a 9.5/10.

Playing this game is like taking yoga for 5 years, training mercilessly day and night. Then finally surgically removing a rib in order to one day suck your own ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, only to discover that the relentless physical torment has left your junk in a hapless defective state. What you will experience from playing this game is 99.9% flaming, scapegoating and being killed by players more invested in this video game experience than you could ever hope to be. The majority of mechanical game-play consists of attacking an AI-controlled unit at the last possible moment in order to obtain a pitiful amount of gold from it. And then proceeding to repeat this action hundreds of times every single game. Still interested? I will not question what may be wrong with you but seeing as you have read thus far I will let you in to this little secret. The reason why people have played this game since it's inception, and have never gotten bored of it. This is the little .1% of pure untampered ecstasy. It is the moment that the scales fall from your eyes to reveal the next level of complexity within the world of dota you once believed to be much simpler. The moment you first overcome your opponent with skill you have sacrificed your blood, sweat and tears to develop. When the stars align and that wombo combo aces the 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•boys stupid enough to challenge you and your brothers in arms. When you comeback from mega creeps (A checkmate in nearly all cases) to snatch the victory which dangled so precariously in the jaws of defeat. Followed by talking so much ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to the early good game flamer on the other team, your mouth may as well be a colostomy bag. This is the high you will achieve from this narcotic we call Dota 2. And you will without a doubt, spend the rest of your life, crawling miserably through the toxic sewerage ala public games in order to once more experience it in all of it's richness and warmth. Truth be told there is no guarantee that you will ever feel that same way again. But it's worth trying. I think.""}]",['570'],['1'],[True],1.0

However, it\'s not pitch black. There\'s always some hope, or some beauty, or some light that keeps this game from being nothing more than a depressing march from start to finish. The game feels more like \'Purgatory\' than \'Hell\', if that makes sense. Hope is frail in Dark Souls, but this game will never leave you feeling completely hopeless. There is ALWAYS a way.Finally, the big question everyone asks: Difficulty?Honestly, Dark Souls is not the brutally difficult game everyone tells you it is. Aside from two or three actually tough bosses, Dark Souls is only as hard as you allow it to be, as cliched as that sounds. If you appreciate learning, can think laterally and can adapt to meet changing situations, Dark Souls is a very enjoyable challenge. If you allow yourself to get easily frustrated, insist on blindly rushing things, and stubbornly refuse to change tactics if required, the game will punish you, and rightly so, because you\'re stupid. There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" plan. Dark Souls doesn\'t punish ""unskilled"" people, it punishes stupid people. In the first hour I couldn\'t even kill a pair of skeletons, now I\'ve finished the game. Perseverance is critical. If you\'re going to think like a loser, you\'re going to be a loser, it\'s as simple as that. There will be times when you\'ll want to throw your hands up in the air. Don\'t do it. Never give up.Dark Souls is honestly not a brutally tough game. For any Brood War players out there, if you could beat ""To Slay The Beast"", you can beat this whole game,  Dark Souls is much easier than that was.So don\'t be afraid, don\'t hesistate, do something positive for yourself, and experience Dark Souls. When you make it to the end, you won\'t regret it. Also, get DSFix. It\'s a painless five minute install, and is absolutely necessary for a good experience.PS - No spoilers, but there\'s this thing called a ""Purging Stone"".

Pumping Iron, clipping guards and taking your clothes off and running around the prison whilst guards are chasing you are only a few things that make up The Escapists.What makes this game so worth your 10 bucks? First of all, it's pixelated. If you're like me, pixelated games will make your heart melt like butter on pancakes. Secondly, it has that sandbox feel, but also a prison architect kind of security system, topped off with humourous remarks and a reason to do everything.It's extremely PC-space friendly as it only takes a mere 18mb to run. You can still enjoy the game whether its your first time playing, or if you had already completed the game more than 10 times. Let me recap : Whats good :-Extremely addictive.-Space friendly.-Indie.-PIXELATED!-Sandbox-y?-Challenging, as well as entertaining.-Humorous Interaction.-Different types of weapons/contraband.-Can get naked.-Only 9.99!What needs improvent:-Music, I turned it off after an hour or so.-Like to see this become co-op.-Characters get buggy occasionally.This game has lots of potential, and it's only in early acess!

The cards that you are dealt can also make you want to uninstall the game, especially when you get dealt dead for 30+ hands. The bots don't know that they're doing, sometimes they flop a house and other times call with air. You cannot predict the bots, and be sure to only all in when you have something higher than two-pair, because this game can screw you up.

(Don't listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered, it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice)Con's:*The inventory whipe kind of killed it for me, I had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics/items craftable, some of my favourites are actually not craftable, such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades.*Australian's may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag, but its usually not unbearable.*Last I checked the co-op survival mode, I believe it was called Horde mode or something, was currently not working, which sucks because it used to be very fun.While the cons I've listed may seem to outweigh the pro's, this is really not the case. Minimum is a very fun game and I can't wait till it's completely restored to its former glory :)Minimum was one of my favourite games.However I would not recommend buying it (not that you can) in it's current state due to:#1 (This is the most important issue) The servers have been down for what seems like an eternity, you cannot actually play the game should you buy it![/b]#2 Prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content. They redid some maps and released a couple new maps, but didn't add any new weapons or armour. (Not that the old developer were any better, as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time). The last content update I remember was an april fools joke! When they added an invisible weapon and armour (the promo for said armour looked awesome, shame they didn't just make that armour)#3 Prior to the server issues the community was very small. Quite often you'd end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them. This was not always the case, as the community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content.Minimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content (it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games) then go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it.

Refuge or god, none are safe from Nikandreos' primal rage as he fights to avenge a quite literally god-forsaken humanity.  A suprisingly varied experience as brilliant in aesthetic as it is in satisfaction from start to finish. I do reccomend playing on the harder difficulty on your first playthrough to get the most out of this game. The lower difficulty leaves you with far too many resources and breathing room. You are killing gods after all, prove yourself worthy to walk upon the Olympian summit. One thing to note about this game is that a lot of your learning is done in a heavily autodidactic fashion. Such little tidbits will follow. Semi spoiler alert relating to the specifics of combat. 1: Sweeping an enemies feet out will throw them into the air.2: Hitting them in the head with your swing will do more damage.3: When blocking, you need to aim your shield at the point of which the attack will impact with you. This is particularly needed in the final fight. 4: If you get into a fight with guards around the 'non-combat' areas, either run as far as you can and hide. (The top left of the screen shows you portraits of who you are in combat with, and will fade away if they lose you.) But if you choose to fight, make sure you don't let them blow their horns. They will summon more dudes to fight and can do this endlessly.5: Middle mouse while blocking to do a shield smack, knocking people back and putting their guard down. 6: Stackable weapons durabilities are individual to that weapon. For example, if you have a spear in your hand it's durability isn't shared with the other 4 hidden on your person. 7: When breaking open stuff, if you have the time switch to your fist not to waste durability on weapons. That's all that comes to mind right now just after finishing the game. I would love to see a similar style game but for Norse mythology instead of Greek. It would be brilliant. Absolutely reccomend this game for fans of souls games type combat.""}, {'funny': '3 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 1, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '225540', 'helpful': '2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""I don't have the time to write a full review, but I just wanted to say that this game, by far, has the worst car driving system in any game I've played.

Basically if you enjoyed Deus Ex: Human Revolution you will enjoy this game (Worth noting that you probably really do need to play it to enjoy it as this is almost a direct continuation in story and you will probably be missing a lot by not playing Human Revolution first). Most the bad reviews are for performance issues and microtransactions but the game itself is solid and very fun. Optional microtransactions that do nothing but give you points to upgrade your character faster in a singleplayer game are hardly worth complaining about. I have 8GB RAM and an MSI Geforce 960 and I do need to run the game on low settings as anything higher gives some incredibly low framerate, especially for the first mission which oddly seems to be the laggiest most taxing area of the game. However I never experienced crashing of any kind, my game sat at 50-60 fps for the majority of the game only dropping between 20-40 in certain areas and usually not for more than a few seconds. However I do have one complaint and that is the games length. Although it is not incredibly short, finishing it as well as a majority of the side quests in about 28 hours total by the end of it I did feel as though I had only finished three quarters or perhaps two thirds of the game. Essentially it left me feeling as though the story needed just that little bit extra length to properly explore and develop the story. Needless to say however this is a Deus Ex game so replayability is always plentiful.Pros:- Good story- Good characters- Great gameplay- Plenty of replayability and challengeCons:- Far less enjoyable story without playing the previous game- Highly demanding for your PC. Be sure to check that you meet the requirements- I guess microtransactions are bad? Even though without them it's the exact same game with one less feature.- Somewhat short. (28 hours)I would all in all rate the game at about a 7 or 8. It's a good game and certainly worth playing with some minor issues. To be honest I think the $60 price is a bit high and is worth more towards $40-$50.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 24, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '1250', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Great game to play alone or with friends.

There's something beautifully satisfying about enterting slow-motion (ZED Time) and watching as you lower your Zweihander (2-Handed Long Sword for the Berserker Class) from above your head in a mighty Zed splitting motion and you split that gorefast in half, slice it's head open and watch all the blood and guts you could want fly out. The new in-game cosmetics are somewhat overpriced, and the range of weapons for each individual class need to be expanded, but overall a great game, lots of fun and stunning graphics! 9/10 for what you'd expect.

PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAME AND ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND POSSIBLE INTERRUPTIONS OF GAME FUNCTIONING."" nearby the trailer of this game. So if you are looking to buy a full completed DayZ stick with the mod for now as Arma 2 on sale is usually $3 along Operation Arrowhead being $2, this game does have many glitches and you will die alot by glitches such as the following but not limited too- Invisi Ladders- Invisi walls- Invisi zombies- Superzombie wall punching- Walking off roofs when eating- Bandages not working- Lag in generalBut all this is expected in a Early Access gameNow that all the bads are out of the way I can start with the goods. The game has a beautiful artstyle that very much fits the zombie apocalypse setting. also i believe night time is done brilliantly but the flashlight may be a bit too bright you could say (Any DayZ player who has used the or seen the flashlight will know what i mean). Seriously, don\'t use the flashlight at night, it\'s a beacon... Anyways, I have to say the interface and inventory screen runs much smoother and is easier to get accustomed too then the Mod version. with nothing clogging up your normal vision and a much easier way to loot and store items into your backpack. Speaking of inventory, DayZ has added the new ability to clothe your character, making it easier to identify people, giving new loot to look for and an all around general gameplay experience, those TTSkO pants could mean the life and death of your character. Also this clothing allows for a new way to store items, some dress items may hold 2-8 spaces and others may hold nothing at all, so it gives (again back to the looting experience) a new way for players to easily pickup and take items without all the hassling around and gives them more stuff to look out for.Now for gameplay, I reckon gameplay can be classified as either 1. Gameplay or 2. Gunplay. So I will cover bothGameplayThe gameplay in DayZ at the time does feel exciting when you first start off and throughout most of your journey to NWAF and back to Elektro or something. but once you sorta get into the higher gear items there becomes less to do, although this has kinda been fixed in the past few updates (Hunting, Fishing and soon to be camptents/camping) you still end up heading down to the coast and preying on Fresh Spawns. But other then that the gameplay of DayZ works real well because you could be roleplaying or just messin around in general.GunplayDayZ weaponry works much like Arma 2 with the exception of melee (I will cover melee near the end) with the change of having to find all your ammo and making sure that ammo is in a pristine - worn condition (Weapon jams may be added in the future). Also, when your new to DayZ you grab whatever firearm is put infront of you, right? but because DayZ implements realism into the firearms you really gotta think if you want to take that Sporter.22 or head to the police station to see for an SKS or such, along with this you have to be aware of what ammo each gun takes and where you can find that ammo, for example if you had the choice between an AKM or an AK101, I will probably go for the AKM as its ammo is relativly easy to find (Counting you found the AKM at a military base) over an AK101, sure the AK101 has a higher fire rate and better accuracy, but the AKM has an easier supply of ammo to be found. Now for the proper gunfights, a gunfight is probably the moment in DayZ where your heart gets pumping knowing that if you die, you lose all that good loot, All dem beans, so this goes back to our weapon problem, because having a good weapon or a bad weapon in a gunfight can result in a different outcome, say if you had a Sporter.22 and you fought a guy with an Mosin, he would probably win, whereas if you had an AKM and you fought a guy with an FNX45 you would probably win. Another important thing you have to know what you\'re fighting, if its a Mosin you know he can get a max of 2 hits on you before your dead, whereas if its an M4A1 he could probs get around 5-10 hits to kill you. But it really all comes down to who fired first and what position that person was in, if your enemy was in a bush on a hill and you aren\'t a full experienced player you will probably die, but if you have the situation reversed, then he will probably die. Now melee weapons are a bit different, you will mostly use a melee weapon for zombies only as 1 punch to the head on a person can knock em out, allowing you to steal loot, although don\'t go punching guys with helmets, \'cause then you will just get a sore hand and probably a few bullet holes. So i prefer to use Melee weapons for zombie encounters only but that is entirely up to you. most melee weapons are 1-2 hits on zombies so that is probably explains why i use them seeing as it will take a few more hits on a player.Anyways all in all i would\'ve given this game an 7/10 because of all the bugs but seeing as it is clearly stated by the developers that you don\'t want to buy this game if you don\'t like bugs, I will exlude the bugs and give it a 9/10'}, {'funny': '3 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted March 22, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '344760', 'helpful': '1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '11/10 would spend 30 minutes trying to connect to an Oceania server again'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted October 30, 2012.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '215470', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'THIS GAME IS AWESOME, U HAVE TO GET IT'}]","['221100', '344760', '215470']","['2', '1', '1']","[True, True, True]",1.0

Es un videojuego de rol de acci√≥n del tipo mundo abierto desarrollado por Bethesda Game Studios y publicado por Bethesda Softworks. Es la quinta entrega de videojuegos de acci√≥n y fantas√≠a de la serie The Elder Scrolls y es posterior a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion y predecesor de The Elder Scrolls Online. Skyrim sali√≥ a la venta el 11 de noviembre de 2011 para las plataformas: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 y PlayStation 3. El 4 de junio de 2013 fueron lanzados al mercado tres complementos descargables: Dawnguard, Hearthfire y Dragonborn.La historia de Skyrim se centra en los esfuerzos del personaje del jugador para derrotar a Alduin, un drag√≥n que, seg√∫n la profec√≠a, destruir√° el mundo. La trama est√° fechada doscientos a√±os despu√©s de los sucesos de Oblivion y tiene lugar en la provincia ficticia de Skyrim. En el transcurso de la partida, el jugador completa misiones y hace evolucionar a su personaje gracias al mejoramiento de sus habilidades. A diferencia de los juegos anteriores de Elder Scrolls, en Skyrim no se requiere que el usuario seleccione un tipo de personaje al inicio del juego, resolviendo as√≠ el problema que el equipo de desarrolladores ve√≠a desde de versiones anteriores: la necesidad de tener que forzar al usuario a un estilo r√≠gido de juego. Skyrim contin√∫a con la tradici√≥n de mundo abierto al permitir que el jugador viaje a cualquier parte del mapa del juego en cualquier momento y postponer indefinidamente u omitir parcial o totalmente la historia principal.Aunque no es una secuela directa de los anteriores juegos de Elder Scrolls, durante su construcci√≥n fue considerado como un sucesor de la filosof√≠a de Oblivion y de Fallout 3 de 2008. El equipo de desarrolladores opt√≥ por un mundo de juego m√°s diverso y √∫nico de lo que fue la comarca ficticia de Cyrodiil en Oblivion, los cuales fueron considerados menos interesantes por su director y productor ejecutivo Todd Howard, en comparaci√≥n con Skyrim. Durante el estreno, recibi√≥ buenas cr√≠ticas por sus cambios, sobre todo en lo tocante al sistema de desarrollo de los personajes, gracias a la experiencia ganada durante el desarrollo de las entregas anteriores de Elder Scrolls. No obstante, tambi√©n recibi√≥ cr√≠ticas negativas en cuanto a la pobreza del acabado en los detalles de los personajes y a los escuetos movimiento durante un combate cuerpo a cuerpo. El juego fue desarrollado utilizando un motor de creaci√≥n elaborado por Bethesda Softworks espec√≠ficamente para este juego. Durante la primera semana de su lanzamiento se enviaron a los minoristas m√°s de siete millones de copias y ha vendido m√°s de 20 millones de copias para las tres plataformas.'}]","['203160', '8870', '285160', '224480', '7670', '72850']","['1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '0']","[True, True, True, True, True, True]",1.0

About a year ago I wrote a review saying that I had no criticisms about it at all. But my opinion has changed to the point where I cannot bring myself to support the developers anymore. I put almost 200 hours into this game over the course of a few years(I know that isn't much for a lot of people but its a lot for me) and absolutely loved it. I did research on all the lore(yes it exists) and followed all of the news and patch notes. No I wasn't godly amazing at the game. But I loved it. I supported it.Then the whole game went downhill in less than a week. The catalyst that set it off was the addition of safes and drills in a similar manner to CS:GO or TF2.I was disappointed to say the least. And so, it seemed, was the community.Further research into the issue highlighted that the developers Overkill had previously promised that they would not ever add microtransactions to the game, something they did with the addition of safes and drills.But I also learned about other things that they had done. They delayed making payments on a prize won at an official tournament hosted by them. They had begun to sell out their brand for cheap promotions, for example the addition of John Wick, or the Alesso Heist.I lost faith in them very quickly. The reddit Q&A with the developers held right after the safe and drills update showed that they had no intention to discuss the community's opinons with answers like, when asked if there was a possibility of them ever reconsidering safes and drills, 'No, we won't' (Or something along those lines, I don't remember the exact wording) I tried to stay loyal, and tried to believe that it was gonna be fine. I hoped that one day they'd see the issue with microtransactions giving stat boosts to weapons. I hoped that they'd at least apologise for the issues that the update has caused for the community. I hoped that even if they wouldn't stop the microtransactions, it would mean the end of paid DLC packs.They didn't apologise. They didn't remove the stat boosts. Despite their financial statements saying that they were making large profits, and despite them saying that they only make paid content when they absolutely have to, they contiued to release paid DLC packs. They did a collaboration with Goat Simulator, of all games. It just shows how greedy they all are if they decide that Goat Simulator is a good idea for a collaboration.The addition of the Goat Simulator DLC was the last straw for me. It just drove home the fact that they didn't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about their consumers.So my message to you is that the game itself isnt terribly designed. However please, for ethical reasons, so that this kind of behaviour does not continue, please do not buy this game and support these greedy and ignorant scumbags.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 26.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '359320', 'helpful': '3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'I actually find it rather difficult to recommend this game, even though it is one of my favourite games ever.And the reason why is the same thing you will hear in all of the serious reviews of the game. It lacks any significant depth.Let me start with the positives.    -The ships are amazing to fly. They all feel different and sound different, as well as look different and perform different.    -Combat is fun and balanced. It requires skills and patience, and is quite rewarding particularly when you manage to take down a larger ship.    -The sound design is absolutely amazing. Each ship sounds unique and all of the sound effects are absolutely superb.    -The game features an insanely in depth background simulation. In each of the hundreds of thousands of inhabited systems, numerous factions each have their own laws, affiliations and influence. A supply and demand based economy allows for dynamic variations in profitability, based on both the background simulation and player actions.    -The game has some of the best community involvement I\'ve ever witnessed. Players influencing the economy has been a feature of many games, but in Elite the devs allow for player created lore-friendly news articles. Player created lore-friendly factions and political gameplay. Player run initiatives, and community goals which can be started and run by players. Elite has community involvement which legitimately shapes the galaxy around how the players act, and it really makes for some amazing opportunities.    -The game is beautiful and well optimised. I\'m running it on a 6 year old laptop with a broken fan and I get smooth fps in almost every situation(excluding some planetary landings with Horizons)    -The game has a lot of freedom. Pretty much the only restriction that will limit what you can do will be your in game credits. Almost everything is available right from the start.This game also has a lot of negatives, however:    -To quote a video game reviewer Yahtzee-""A game where the player can do anything is a game that focusses on nothing."" Elite lacks depth. The trading mechanics are lackluster and basic. The combat, although fun, lacks much significant purpose and become very repetitive. Exploration is also something that gets quite repetitive quite quickly, and the way that the mechanics repeat themselves just ends up boring a lot of people.    -Missions are worthless and in some cases, broken. This is going to be fixed with Horizons patch 2.1 hopefully, but as it stands missions often do little to increase someone\'s balance.    -The game is horrifically bad at explaining almost all of the mechanics. The first tutorial essentially tells you that left click = fire weapons and then ends. I have had this game for many months now and I am still learning about how some of the most basic mechanics actually work, and that was because I have done a lot of research into how to do things in the game.Overall, I personally love Elite Dangerous, but many people find that it is boring or much too difficult or unfinished. And I think these claims are justified. I would say that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy Elite, particularly in its current state. If you are the type of person who is able to self motivate yourself to participate in the galaxy as if you were actually living in it then I absolutely must recommend this game. If you are the type of person who wants a game for casual fun, then I don\'t recommend buying the full game, perhaps just buy Arena instead.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted September 10.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '354380', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""As a fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise, Chronicles: China leaves a bit to be desired, but is still a decent enough time sink.The story:The story in Chronicles: China is quite average at best. Shao Jun is an assassin many fans already knew about from an animated short released some years ago. When the game was announced I was excited to see Shao Jun finally getting a bit of expansion on her story. Unfortunately, the game's story is very poorly told, and is quite short. Shao Jun is on a revenge quest for reasons not explained in the game, and she undergoes extreme character development at the end of the game which doesn't really make any sense when compared to the rest of the pacing. If you were looking for the Shao Jun story that the whole community wanted, I'm afraid this isn't it.The gameplay:Gameplay holds up well, for the most part. Stealth is interesting and has many mechanics which will make you think about each scenario before approaching. The parkour is simple, but works extremely well, and in some of the escape missions it just feels so good to run and jump at high speeds, particularly since the game has some stunning animations for a platformer. There were only two issues I had with the gameplay. The combat in the game is quite fiddly and certainly doesn't have any of the smoothness which you see in the other aspects of the game. Although there are multiple types of attack moves and counters and options in a fight, the game just starts to break pace as soon as you enter a fight, and it really becomes an annoyance very early on, and this is not helped by the fact that you have very little health until the end of the game, and even then you can't afford to fight too many people at once. It is also not helped by some of the worst keymapping I've ever seen. Having to press c and hold a direction to counter is just such a bad idea. I strongly recommend using a controller for this game, because it holds up significantly better.Atmosphere:Some of the levels seem devoid of much atmosphere, particularly with the predominantly muted greys and blacks the game seems to favour so much. That said, many of the viewpoints offer stunning vistas all displayed in a beautiful calligraphic art style. The music is a mixed bag. Sometimes it just sits in the background with very little substance, and at some points really makes getting through the levels a chore. On the occasion that the music picks up, however, it does so very well and at least for me, kept me motivated to finish a level.Overall:Chronicles: China is okay. If you're looking for the Shao Jun story we all wanted, you won't find it here. The game mechanics mostly work very well, with the exception of combat, meaning that if you want a stealth platformer to pass the time, then by all means grab this game, it'll keep you satisfied for a few hours.""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted January 26.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited January 26.', 'item_id': '391540', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""If you're one of those anti-undertale hipsters or a cynical haterTake off your shades.

I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great.

But aside from that its overall a good game with some Quirks to, In the start and does a good job of making you care and feel for the charecters.Graphics...For them to go with this style was definately a good choice the graphics arant super ultra realstic, They take a more comic book art style and the reason why it fits the game better is becuase the Walking dead started in comic book form, And for them to interigrate the same style into a game and make it look Brillent then stick with it, Not only does it make the game more timeless but make you feel like that your in the comic book following the story of someone else.The Zombies in this game, in the first season they reused alot of zombie skins and it seems like they will do the same in season two and to be honest the skins are pretty cool and so is zombie animation the Reused Zombie skins could use abit more randomiztion but overall excuseble given the amount of time these poeple have, Gotta scarfiece something right?This game is fine sometimes quirky and extremly emotional if your looking for a game to rip out your heart then patch it up t only rip it right back out again, This is your game.Review by Reaver and the Doctor, Friend me if you wanna get you game reviewed or get a opinion till then, Derp on.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 2, 2013.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited October 11, 2014.', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': '0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""CORRECTION LADIES AND GENTLEMENAfter servel billion problems I have deemed this game to be 1/10, Why?problems such asTextures breaking 24'7Taking forever to load Addons breaking every dayFaulty codingSometimes crashes your DesktopHas a dishonest CreatorCrashes every time you try to do somethingOH and well there is lots of lots and lots lagAnd its not worth your money it might cost you 10 dollars now but it will cost you Trillions in hospitial bills from the stress!~Sincerly Reaver.PS.

It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.""}]",['297000'],['0'],[False],0.0

Keep in mind it is the ""HD Remake"" not ""Fable 4."" So many people are giving this game a bad name for the wrong reasons, its been 10 Years since the release of the original game and to celebrate Lionheart have done a HD Remake of their game, of course it will run the same.Now lets talk about the gameplay. Fable Anniversary has been masterfully re-crafted the original Fable with beautiful textures. Its absolutely stunning, I could not help myself staring at the landscape while being ganked by couple of those filthy hobbes and bandits. The game ran smoothly for me and could not help myself reminicise good moments when I was playing Fable TLC. Combat system is still fantastic like its predecessor although some of the enemies I thought were just cheap and annoying. The NPCs are still funny and a tad stupid like one time I just went to the Bowerstone Inn for a Quest when random villagers kept applauding and laughing at me when I was trying to have a chat with a Quest Giver. The story for me is still excellent and lovely. Pretty much my experience with this game have been awesome the only problems were some of the bugs that were initally on before the update. Controls for the PC are a bit strange and would personally recommend controller. Now everything is great. Even though the game might not seem new this game has ""mods"" which will definitely have some bonuses. So overall, this game I would recommend to people, even though people might say this game is trash it is their opinion.

Its fine orchestral melodies give a fantastic atmosphere in-game. The combat system is pretty basic and lovely, I am still not a fan of it since I prefer more of a Turn-Based Mechanic like Civilization and so on. Still its good but I stress everytime when I am doing a move and if I click on the wrong menu I am losing precious seconds giving the enemy AI an opportunity to defeat my party. The Story is great, you play as a Dark Knight called Cecil (Or in my game ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•) who follows the orders of supreme tyrant king. He and his Red Wings go to the City of Mysidia and attack on its peaceful people for its crystal. I won\'t go on any longer with the story, but becomes interesting the more you know. The Characters in game are all facinating and quite lively, the cut-scenes in the game include voice-overs which I found great. Finally, Final Fantasy IV succeeds on being a True JRPG, the only thing I had problem with  was what to do next? In this game, I am told what to do and when accomplish I just don\'t know what to do or go where. A bit more guidance in-game would have done the trick. Also this game has very good ""Engrish,"" you will notice some when you read the text carefully.Overall this game I found it a  good rendition on my Steam Library and cannot wait for more of the Final Fantasy Games to get on steam. The is excellent fulfulling what a JRPG should do with excellent music, interesting story and well-thought characters.

Zombies love attacking barricades but they are usually too dumb to go through a diagonal gap - use that to your advantage.Also remember you can only build/buy during the day.

Extremely short. RPG Maker games are being pumped out pretty quick and they are starting to all feel same-same.I believe I purchaed this game at 96% off, no doubt seeing that the cards will mean that I'll make the money back on the game (don't you love how Steam does this every now and then?). Achievements is a plus as I do like hunting for extras within a game and sometimes this provides some replayability. Well, I played it, twice (to get all of the achievements) and noticed that I still had a single card drop left. This is a short game. At full price, I'd feel ripped off.The game concepts were good and I'd wish they could have extended it somehow or made it more branching (as compared to kill/not kill). It could also be a bit darker, at least it would have made you think about the choices you were making a bit more.tl;dr - If it's only a few cents and you're a card trader or achievement hunter, go for it.

While the game was enjoyable it's not going to be one of those horror games that you'll get your friends over to play, there are other horror games better suited to that. At only 3 hours it's over quite quickly with no replayability apart from ensuring that you grab all of the achievements.

This isn\'t a drifting simulator. This isn\'t a racing game. This is a chilled out explorer and you play the role of an AE86.I hope they make Absolute Drift 2 and give more substance. An ability to modify the car that would have an effect on the physics would be cool as well as camera angles. Obviously multiplayer for some door-on-door drifing action would be great and anything to make this a game that you\'d want to go back to once you unlocked everything that needed to be unlocked.Is it worth US$11.99?

Once you are done deciding which hero you want you can unlock 1 hero for free to lvl it to 60 (I suggest taking Deadpool 1st, since he has no energy cost and is fun to play).   Everytime you play the game, the game will drop Eternity Splinters for you to pick up, don\'t ignore them. You can use those Eternity Splinters to buy more heroes from the \'Eternity Splinter"" vendor. You don\'t need to spend real/steam money for playing the game. The only thing you can might need to spend money is the costumes, but random costumes can be crafted too when you do Prestige. Prestige is releveling a hero from 0 to 60 once again, everytime you prestige you get a original costume of a hero, you can use 3 of the original costumes to craft 1 random costume.  There is atleast 1 event going on every month which will keep you hooked up to the game. The devs make sure the events are glitch-free.  The only thing I don\'t like about this game is that the default inventory is too short, and the Eternity Splinter price of STASH is also too high (600 Splinters) which takes long time to aquire compared to Random hero unlock box (175 Splinters).

I personally believe that this game is boring and unsatisfying. One of my main reasons for unsatisfaction is that I was a WC3 player and so I more enjoy games with an isometric camera to be about building an army and/or base. I prefer commanding armies but less so commanding a singular hero. I PERSONALLY believe that MOBAs should be more like Smite with a third person perspective.

Before I talk about the positives I'm going to talk about the negatives which there are very few of yet still there. To start with it seems to be a bit expensive for what it is, I understand that maybe the devs need a bit more money to get more people into the game. Yet it does seem like it should be F2P seeing as it has microtransactions (optional) a difficult leveling up system and of course having the word online smacked straight into the title (not that all online games are f2p just that lots on steam are). The devs i think would get alot more sales if they lowered their prices down to below $10 or just make it f2p. Also at the time of this review post whenever I go on there only seems to be 100 - 400 people online which, lets be honest, isnt that much for a full online game, I have often either joined back to the same lobby I left or kept running into the same people even on different days. I do also understand that they cant just make more people play their game but this is still a flaw, it just needs time to fix.Dispite these negatives the game is still amazing, it has a vast array of mounted guns, repair tools, ammo types, power ups and it is a very team based game. The most amazing thing I've liked about it so far, is that it isnt just a run and gun shoot anything to move sort of game. There is actual strategy, for example if you had a motar and a gatling gun, yes the motar does more damage yet its not the greatest at taking down shields so you take down the shields with the gatling gun then fire the motar to do extreme damage and it takes down a ship faster then if you just shot wildly at them with both guns. SUM UP:Guns of Icarus is an amazing game and is some of the most fun I've had playing a game, if you're looking for a causual game to play it its probably not the best option but if you're looking for hours of intense fun with friends and other randoms this game is definatly worth the full $15 or even the $30 for 3 other copies to give away to your friends.

The only good thing about this game is that it is I think first game of its console-adventures that was ported to PC. I played this game with long breaks for almost two years. I still can't find anything so  appealing to so many people in this game.  Boring, bad story, cliched, too much shooting and not enough dialogs. Oh and characters are just screaming to get to know them better but there are basicaly no dialogs. Well its not Quantum Dreams game  anyways. So, should you play it? Yes BUT only if you play with xbox360 controller and its your first time with consoles-adventure.

I bought the second season of TWD in may and after first episode i dropped it for a couple of months. I just finished it yesterday. Well, unfortunately this sequel is suffering from the same illness that AMC TWD series has. It started great in first season and each season is changing the show from survival show to soap opera. This game is suffering from this as well. It's not as thrilling as first season. Story is dull, boring, dialogs are uniteresting and in some cases scenes are too long and static like the one where characters talk by camp fire in Ep4. The characters, oh my. In sequel I found only one  character fairly interesting beside Clementine - it's Jane. Other characters are just lame. I didn't care about what would happen to them or if they die or not. This kind of Visual Novel (yes, its nothing more) at least should be based on good story and strong characters. But its not. Appart of lame characters, bad story, crappy dialogs there is not much game in game. You just don't play much. This sequel is based on ABSURD number of TERRIBLE QTEs. If you like hitting a keyboard key like  a frenzy monkey then go ahead play it. If not, then this game is going to be a torture for you. The choices in this game as in first season are simply just a detour to the linear story. In first season it was hidden much better, because the story was better. To show you how bad second season is I dare to say, that each short episodes of Season 1 DLC 400 days was MUCH more interesting than whole second season! What a shame that TellTale made this sequel. After finishing it I am not going to buy nex season if they make it at all. I do not believe this dev anymore and I am pretty sure, the will be pushing strong for their own DRM of which I am not a fan. So the final verdict. If you must have every game about Zombies buy it.If you are TWD fan, don't buy it.First season was imho 9/10400 days was decent 7/10Second season is well below average game, so:3/10. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to my big sadness :(.Edited: spelling errors.

Despite so many hours of trying to beat this boss I wasnt able to do so. I am sorry, but If a game on easy level is so difficult that player can't finish one of six chapter then there is something wrong with a game.

The second issue, which happens to be the largest deterrent, is the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, freezing and crashes which makes playing the game incredibly frustrating. Seriously Ubisoft... get your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• together and fix this!'}]","['72850', '12500', '25900', '48220']","['2', '0', '2', '2']","[True, True, True, True]",1.0

With the DLC the game is exceptional but it costs far too much money to play the game without getting bored.If you bought all the DLC for $400... You could have bought 50 if not more games for that value, cheap-ish ones of course but there are many impressive indie games out there, especially now that the summer sales are going round so you can get over 100 games and still have some change.But as we all know EA are notorious for DLC so asking for less DLC that is cheaper would be asking too much so only buy this game if you have seen gameplay of the core game and seem interested enough or if you want to play for DLC.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 7, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited March 7, 2014.', 'item_id': '264200', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Fast paced, 2D, action, fighting game in which you click the left and right mouse button to attack or pick up weapons depending on which side of you are on, very addictive and very fun and would be great on other gaming platforms such as mobile devices and even on console.Pick it up whilst its hot!'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted May 12, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited August 21, 2015.', 'item_id': '265930', 'helpful': '1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""This is a cheap, fun, addicting and stupid game that I would recommend for any gamer, casual or hardcore.

Whilst looking at a table for example... It\'s just a table, no need to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yourself.Unfortunately this game has a habbit of glitching on objects and the terrain, after reading other reviews before playing I learnt that people died by jumping on barrels and such so I avoided that, but upon entering the upstairs area of the inn I slightly clipped a door frame which resulted in my character being paralyzed and ending in his untimely demise thanks to fall damage, dispite me not falling even a millimetre.After the dissapointment of my death I decided to start a new game on paranormal difficulty, and boy was I surprised. My character spawned holding the axe, the crowbar, the lantern, and flashlight and the gun and the book was also being held, I also had another pair of arms and hands, and I hadn\'t even picked anything up. None of the items were useable at that which resulted in a very buggy group of items on my screen, interested to see what else was broken I decided to approach the car to pick up the flashlight and the book, however my character was incapable of doing so, I approached the items and there was no interaction button even after spamming the ""e"" key, he picked nothing up. The game was also lagging immensley at this point as opposed to all the other difficulties (the lag was likely all the glitchy items). And in turn the game crashed.However the scares can be surprising so the horror aspect can still be found, however do not get this game if you dislike unfinished, frustrating, glitchy games.Update: after deciding to give this game an extra chance I played it for a couple of hours over the weekend and I was dissapointed :/ I encountered the teleportation bug that teleports me anywhere on the map randomly which was very frustrating and I was continuously dieing of fall damage when clipping an object. There are multiple glitchy textures thqat need seeing to also, what the develepers should focus on in the next update is not releasing up chapters but updating the existing chapters, I would play Chapter 2 but it doesn\'t detect that I own Haunted Memories so unfortunately I can\'t, but I\'ve seen gameplay footage of it and there are also countless bugs and even spelling mistakes in the dialogue.Urgent Update is Needed'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 8, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited March 8, 2014.', 'item_id': '230410', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Tenno unite in this epic rpg based in our solar system and the planets within.

It is more of a everyman for himself game, but you can work together if you wish.Regardless, we are here for the actual review.There are two teams: The Survivors versus The Killer.The Survivors have to activate a series of generators in order to power up a door to escape.The Killer has to hunt, chase and capture survivors, where he then impales them on a meathook. The Survivor on the hook slowly bleeds out, and any remaining survivors can choose wherether to try and save them, or leave them for dead.The round ends when all 4 survivors have escaped, died or a combination of the two.After each round, each player earns a currency called 'Bloodpoints', which can then be spent in the 'Blood Web.' Bloodpoints are shared across all 7 playable characters, while each character has their own unique Blood Web.Each survivor has 3 unique perks that only they have access to. For example, every survivor has the option to get 'Small Game', which allows them to highlight bear traps at a small radius, but only Jake Park has the option to get 'Iron Will', which reduces the noises he makes while injured.As the survivors get higher in their Blood Web, they get 'teachable perks', which lets the other survivors get those originally unique perks. Other then these perks, the survivors don't have any other unique abilities, and have to rely on stealth to make it out alive.Similar to the survivors, the killers also have 3 unique perks, which can later be taught.There are 3 different killers, with more being included in the future.The Trapper is able to set beartraps around the map, catching survivors who walk into them.The Wraith is able to become semi-invisible, making it easier to sneak up on the survivors.The Hillbilly has a chainsaw. Yeah, you can guess what that does.The Killer plays entirely in a first-person perspective with a very low field of view. This is meant to simulate real predators in the wild, who focus solely on hunting their prey.On the other hand, the Survivors play in a third-person perspective, which allows them to look around corners without exposing themselves. They are meant to focus on situational awareness, and staying alive.The Survivors have no way of fighting back to the Killer, and they have to rely on hiding, fleeing and delaying the Killer to have a chance of surviving.All in all, this has been a very enjoyable experience, and I will give it a 8.5/10.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 26.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '252490', 'helpful': '0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '* Saw the plane deploy the supply drop* Chased after it* See four well-equiped men* Hide in bushes* ""By the way, there is a naked guy in that bush over there""* They start shooting at me* I run for my life screaming* I fall off a cliff and go down* I start screaming for help* They start shooting at me* A random helps me up* Random is shot and killed* I swim away to safety11/9 Game Of The Year'}, {'funny': '3 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted October 22, 2015.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited December 6, 2015.', 'item_id': '218620', 'helpful': '1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""I really enjoy PAYDAY 2, as do many of my friends.

Cutting all of that sophisticated sounding stuff out, just wow. I started playing the game and noticed that you only had 2 options in the menu, Start and Exit...

Civilisation V is the type of game that one plays when they have a few hours to spare, each session lasting between 5-10 hours, sometimes even 20. Although this may seem quite daunting to those who haven't experienced the joy of defeating barbarians that have ravaged your land and taken your workers for over 1000 years, the game is captivating enough to make time fly, literally ingame and out, as in 1 turn is 100 years, get it... Bad jokes aside, the game is designed brilliantly, containing beautiful graphics, allowing players to view the board in a 3d or strategic way. When you first load up the screen and you see buttons and words on all 4 sides of the display, don't be discouraged by this, I will admit that for a board game, it has far more mechanics then one would normally expect, including things such as technology trees, policies, productions, settling, etc. the list could go on forever! But these rules and ideas can be picked up pretty quickly, seeing as how you will be playing it for many hours, and this allows for another aspect of the game, Discovery. You will find that initially the map will seem quite small, sometimes even wondering 'How are we gonna spead out and conquer the world with this minute amount of land'. But as you start building troops and scouts and boats, you quickly realize how small your city is compared to the land that awaits you, granted the map size and pace of the game can all be changed in the game settings. The multiplayer mode can also be one of the most ridiculous (in a good way) way of finding out the true nature of your friends, whether it be through them starting a war with you, forming an alliance, plotting with you to backstack some other poor friend that you both think might win the game. The multiplayer mode, I have found, becomes a better tutorial than the tutorial that the game has to offer, allowing you to learn faster with a person that know the rules and can interact with you as opposed to the AI that pops up messages every so often that tells you the obvious. Caution: If you're playing this at night with some friends over voice chat, remember to close your door as you will find yourself shouting and yelling. Why? well you'll have to play to find out...Overall, this game will not disappoint you, introducing new mechanics and ideas every step of the way, straining and developing your brain as you panic over losing money and resources, essentially plonking you in a position of a world leader and seeing how far you can make your civilastion survive. I recommend this game to everyone of all ages, if they're looking for a relaxed way to spend their day, but if your looking for fast action, FPS, bloodsplattery goodness, you might want to try something else.""}]","['250600', '8930']","['0', '2']","[True, True]",1.0

They are great, fun, and silly... though there\'s a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal ""new"" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of ""Honourable combat"", ""Casual rulemaking"" and ""Improvisation mid combat""""Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...""Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there\'s nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging ""epic memorable moments"", everything feels fair (even when it\'s unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a ""Mutators screen"" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it\'s just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It\'s also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you\'re running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn\'t lose it\'s lustre quickly, Get it if you\'re sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you\'re the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!'}, {'funny': '6 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted November 25, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '344740', 'helpful': '13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Cryptark is like sex. Anticiption, tense sweaty busy work all building to a final brain numbing elation.The options of weapons grows as you play through the game, Shotguns, rockets, ramming spikes all feel as if they have the right amount of gravitas attached.Choosing how you breach a derelict alien ship is offered as a flexible and rigourous challenge. Random ship interiors, a new puzzle follows emerges every time you load up a schematic.Once you have your plan of action, the reckless dash to clear the ship of it's repair systems, then it's shields, then it's alarm systems, then it's core is in such a frenetic rush... Nukes deserve their own paragraph. Never in any game before this have i felt i have had not enough hands... Humbling, yet glorious. The quickest way to destroying an evil headache part of the ship without having to deal with battling the ship part down is to arm a nuke to destroy it for you The catch is that you have to take your hands off the mouse ~ your only hope of removing incoming threats ~ to arm the nuke in a tense code input sequence. This leads to Exhillarating payoffs as you see a shield system burn to cinders,Everything builds up to destroying the core in malestrom of pink brain lazers and grenade exposions everywhere... It's a very suitable climax, everything you did up to this point leads up to it, and it never disappoints or feels stale.Once the core is destroyed, everything slows down and stops... and everything you were doing catches up with you. I have never felt so fatigued after finishing a level, I can rarely play this for more than 30 minutes without becoming exhausted. The tension in the game is kept high enough to stretch your nerves thin and keep your eyes peeled...It's a masterpiece, if you can keep up and not get overwhelmed with fast paced games... just get it.""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 20, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '272890', 'helpful': '5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""I LOVE THIS GAME!fanciful, frustrating, fantastic. the atmosphere in the game is dripping wet from the blood and sweat the developers put into the game.

Nuclear Throne is a Rogue-lite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs. Your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies. There is a large variety of guns which I doubt I've done more than merely scratch the surface of. The core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and I will continue to put hours into this gem. I do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game. The framerate is capped at 30. I have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio, not necassarily the devs though. Apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change. Perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly it's not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and it's not in first person. Also the game is played in a 4:3 window within a 16:9 interface. I think this is an odd design choice but hey- It hasn't affected the gameplay for me. I would also love a story mode for this game, it doesn't have to be 30 hour campign or anything but I think it would enhance the experience for me. I will ot however hold this against the devs.Overall - 9/10I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable.

That isn‚Äôt to suggest that the game isn‚Äôt soloable, it certainly is once you learn how to play the game. However, you may not find the game as entertaining as if you did play in a group. With this line of thought I'll site the Borderlands games as comparable (better with friends than solo). If you do have friends to join you then you‚Äôre really going to be in for a treat. The ability to kill mob after mob after mob while rescuing animals being attacked by game hunters is a lot of fun. The graphics are perfect for what the game needs, the sound is fine and the game play is smooth. You will find some people complaining about bugs and other annoyances in the game but in my time with the game I did not notice anything out of the ordinary which correlates to the more recent or updated reviews who claim that a patch repaired the game.There are a wide variety of weapons and other tools/power ups that players can utilize and although you are thrown in from the deep end, a lack of tutorial hurts the game, once you begin to understand what you are doing in regards to the quests the game opens up. It‚Äôs an easy game to recommend to those of you who enjoy action games especially for the price. However do note that the game was bundled in its greenlight phase and that‚Äôs generally a sign that the game will ultimately find itself in another bundle sooner than later. Still, this one is worth the small price especially if you can get into that local co-op.For more reviews similar to this and regular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/""}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted April 7.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '444190', 'helpful': '8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'I‚Äôm not as high on erobotan‚Äôs Princess‚Äô Edge ‚Äì DragonStone as what other user reviews on Steam are. However, it is still a game that I am happy to recommend to old school gamers looking for their next fix on the Beat ‚Äôem up genre especially those who grew up loving and playing the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of Golden Axe. A lot of people thought that the genre was long gone but occasionally a developer who like me grew up feasting on the genre will attempt to rekindle it with varying degrees of success.When you‚Äôre playing one of these types of games you‚Äôre not necessarily looking for the best graphics or sound. What you‚Äôre after is maximum playability ‚Äì intuitive controls that are fun to play and an often surprising amount of options and opportunities to employ strategy. We love the never ending brutality that these games have. We look for epic boss fights and various different encounters that make us actively think about what an enemy‚Äôs greatest point of weakness is and how to overcome seemingly unimaginable odds to beat each level until we‚Äôve either defeated the game or reached a point where you obsess about what it will take to overcome that level. Even the most skilled players of the genre can struggle against different types of bosses.Therefore you‚Äôre not going to find the latest and greatest graphics here. The graphics that are in the game are basic but they serve their purpose quite well. Although others may disagree I enjoyed the in game sound more than I did the graphics. The tunes are catchy albeit a little on the repetitive side. The challenge in the game is pivotal and it achieves what it sets out to to a significant degree. This is definitely the highlight of the game. I think the balance is more than suitable for the genre though younger players may find the game a little on the difficult side ‚Äì which is the intention. A final positive that I want to mention are the number of special moves featured in the game already. That is a definite advantage and should theoretically provide some replayability as you attempt different play styles.Where the game falls short, at least for now, is that there are only five stages and nine regular enemy types. The developer claims that this is already a finished game but it is too much on the short side. I‚Äôd like to see a lot more content added to the game. I‚Äôd bring the game up to at least eight different levels with each level having a boss fight. I‚Äôd also like to see the game become more Steamified with achievements and trading cards added to the game. Local co-op would be another option that I would like to see considered, however, that may unbalance the gameplay and make it too easy.This is a cool game and one that brings back memories which is clearly the intention of the developer. I hope they continue along their game development pathway.Visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways'}]","['423840', '444190']","['0', '2']","[True, True]",1.0

The first being the VERY long tutorial/training section of the game. Without any spoilers, you almost have to go through Connor's entire childhood before you are really set free upon the world. Also on the PC version, there were some graphical and audio glitches. While we are discussing the PC version, one of the biggest issues I had was how badly optimized this game was for PC. Don't get me wrong, I have a GTX 770 and a 4770K, which are by no means entry level or mid range. However, I still had MAJOR, and I mean MAJOR frame rate drops. I would coasting along at 60FPS and then suddenly as I turn the conner to look at 4 people, BAM!!! 40FPS.In conclusion, I would skip this game I were you.

Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It\'ll start!An oldie but a goodie!IL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It\'s detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it\'s an awesome game. Given it\'s pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky. There\'s a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import. These days there\'s plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.Damage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.I\'d recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I\'d suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you\'ll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I\'ve played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I\'m still  more nervous about landing than combat!There\'s also some ""what if?"" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They\'re fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don\'t add to the realism. There\'s some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.This is not for the casual gamer. I can\'t stress this enough. This game demands your attention and your commitment. do so and it\'ll reward you. A number of real-life veterans have said this game captures the difficulty of ww2 air combat. Don\'t expect an easy ride.'}]","['239820', '15320']","['2', '2']","[True, True]",1.0

Unique and engaging crafting system and player economy system. Easy to level with challenging quests, side quests and minigames. Unique and innovative combat and character skills systems. Ability to purchase in game content that aids in raising skills or earn similar content with your own in game time and effort.Cons : The game is a little complicated to learn to begin with. One cannot simply dive in and understand the systems without going through the tutorials and I highly recomend reading the wiki and watching the tutorial videos that are available. The open pvp system is really kind of a let down for me, it encourages targeting of new and lower level characters by those who have higher levels and for my tastes really hurts the new players over all experience. While I applaud the ability to earn decent equipment and skills through time and effort. I still find that the real game perks lean toward those who pay for the vip status. Not so much that I would call it an outright pay to win game but enough to hinder some of the gameplay for me and make leveling a bit of grind.Over all I love the game. There is still a lot for me to learn about it and the team is developing new content and recently brought a new server online as well. If you love adventure RPG's and dont mind taking the time to learn the new and innovative systems then Divine Souls is definately worth trying.""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted April 30.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '449680', 'helpful': '22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'just no'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 23, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '387240', 'helpful': '2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'a lot of fun!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 30, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '207750', 'helpful': '1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""i'm pleasantly surprised.. this game is quite cool. it'll be one of the few steam games i actually keep installed on my HD""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted May 20.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '292030', 'helpful': '3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""man i can't wait for blood and wine to come out!!!""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 25, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '620', 'helpful': '0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'one of the best games ever made'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 23, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '238210', 'helpful': '0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""i'm in love with this game.. and to think i wanted to quit when it was too hard about 2-3 hours in... i'm glad i stuck with it""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 19, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '70', 'helpful': '0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Incredible!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 1, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '45760', 'helpful': '0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'The best game on steam!

The few hours I spent playing Episode 1 and 2 of this game moved me enough to write a review. I'll keep this as TL:DR as possible.This game will make you fall in love with games and remind you that they are a platform for art just as much as books/comics/movies/tv.People will make comparisons to the Telltale Games series. Genre and mechanics are similar, but very refreshingly different in all other aspects.PROS:-Incredibly in-depth, immersive and changeable storyline-Unpredictable-Best soundtrack of any game ever-Characters you actually care about-Ability to take back your initial choices, but be forced to live with the consequences of your final decisions-See if you made the same choices as the rest of the world after playing through an episode-Stunning, smooth and in-depth visuals-Voice acting is top-notch-A world you will love to lose yourself in-So many feelsCONS:-Trailer gives away too much-Lip-synching and facial expressions do not align with the dialogue a lot of the time, has the unfortunate side-effect of reminding you you're playing a game-Many will find the episodes too short, personally I found them perfectly timed.-Waiting for the next episode is painful, like Game of Thrones painful-In the 'previously on' sequence at the start of Episode 2, you are shown the pivotal moments from the last episode, but not the pivitol decisions you made in those moments - a sorely missed opportunity.-You will most likely be left with a sense of melancholy aimlessness after playing, because nothing can quite stack up to what you've just experienced.

It feels very much like it was developed for tablets only.The game pace is terrible slow. Most of the time you will just sit around and waiting for the pink bubbles (your mana points, which allow you to do things like terra forming etc.) to pop up above each of your settlements, which you then have to collect by clicking on them. Let me repeat that: if you have 200 settlements, you have to click 200 different pink bubbles to collect your ""mana points"" and progress in the game. So most of the time you end up just sitting around doing nothing and just wait for the next bubbles to click on, which is as much fun as watching paint dry - except that paint will dry much faster than this game progresses.

Complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. The game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. This enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. Your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your Civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. More science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. Only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish.

Not only does it reinvent the spooky feeling that The Binding of Isaac gave us, but it gives the player a sense of exploration, With the rooms being larger and the amount of enemies in each room sufficing the space. Visually satisfying and game mechanics are great, unlocking new levels as you play through. At the beginning is may seem quick the game, but as you finish it again and again unlocking more things and donating extra gold to the shop. You will find that you are hooked at playing it. Given that there are 178 achievements, you would be busy for a while to hunt them all down!!Grinding and grinding to unlock all the characters, all the secrets and all the endings. Easily can sink 5 hours a day into this. As you may see i have not done so with my hours on this but I sure am planing to.All in all I found Rebirth absolutely brilliant. I recommend it to anyone. Although it can be a rage inducer at times. Beating Mum then dying to a mob, one of the most infuriating moments in a game, but alas.

Some parts you will get stuck and cannot figure out what to do. But paying close attention to absolutely  everything is the key. I know some might phase out after a while.But I do reccommend you play this in one sitting whilst everything is still fresh in your mind so do not forget places or what you need to do.Always check your diary, It is your best friend.Other than that.

I mostly play competetive and deathmatch, but there's also other modes such as casual if you don't want to be involved in ranks or waiting for the 20 hour cool down after playing too much competetive.Don't get intimidated by the fact of buying guns and knives, because they are simply just skins and don't give the player that spent $400 on a knife any advantage over the player that spent $0. However the cool thing about steam is being able to sell cards and other items which you can use to purchase weapons or buy crates and keys to have a chance to win better guns and knives.You do get a few hackers and afk players every know n' then but they are easily kicked with the easy team voting system. The main problem I have is smurfs, which are players that make other accounts and may seem as a low rank but actually have a higher rank making them unfair as they play with lower ranks even though they are much more skilled.Finally gamplay, the gameplay is very smooth and well thought out. Low rank players play with low rank players and high rank players play with high rank players. All guns have their advantages and disadvantages such as long range, short range, recoil, damage, fire rate and accuracy. Each map has well placed objects which can be used as cover.Overall this game is a MUST! I reccommend cs:go to any fps gamer or even any average gamer in general.""}]",['730'],['2'],[True],1.0

It's actually overwhelming and some of them don't even fit the Payday 2 theme. There's way more than $100 worth of DLC in this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and it adds up to a butt load of updates and patches and whatnot. Do you know what updates and patches do? They add to the game. Do you know what adding to the game does? It increases file size. Look at it: this game is larger than TF2, GTA 4 and Garry's Mod. That's actually stupid as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.These guys started out as a four man team (5 if you technically include old Hox when he was in prison) who were bank robbers. Now they're a 14 man team of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing terrorists. Seriously, they're legitamit terrorists now. Out of every heister they've added, only like 2 or 3 actually have a decent backstory or real reason for being on the team: Clover, Jiro and Hoxton. Literally no one else really deserves to be on the team. John Wick? Bodhi from Point Break? Jacket from Hotline Miami? Non of those make any real sense. They tried to explain it in the John Wick trailer for him  but after that is was basically a '‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it' from Overkill and they just didn't try for promotional characters. Jacket looks like he's in his 20's in game but if this game takes place in the same universe as Hotline Miami he'd be in his late 40's. None of it makes any sense.The base game is amazing and if they stopped releasing payed DLC's at about the second Gage Weapon Pack (they should just release all Gage Whatever Packs as one DLC at lease) and just had the rest be free from then on, no one would've ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed and I would probably be able to recommend this game. What really bugs me is how they make a DLC for every individual thing they add. For example The Diamond Heist was added at about the same time Clover was added. The Diamond Heist was a one part map that was kind of suppose to be Shadow Raid 2 but was in the end short and easy as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. It costs $7. Clover was linked to The Diamond Heist mostly story wise if you paid attention and her individual pack cost like $5-7 at the time. Why the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• would you not release the two together in the same DLC? Buying both individually as two separate DLC's costs just over or around %50 of the actual game's cost. This goes for, as previously mentioned, the Gage Weapon Packs (or just all the weapon packs in general), The Dentists Heists (Alesso, Golden Grin and Big Bank should be together. The Diamond can get a pass here if they combined it with the Clover pack but they could just have all The Dentist jobs together as a whole AND include Clover in them and whoever else was added in the Dentist's jobs (Sokol)) and have all the collaboration heists and characters just be free updates if you want (but seriously, I have to pay $7 for a GOAT SIMULATOR HEIST). And I'm guessing if you've made it this far you want me to touch on the microtransactions? Well They're microtransactions in a $20 game that has more than $100 worth of DLC. Sure Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a $15 game with microtransactions but at least they have free updates, not DLC's and the microtransactions in the game when you really think about it kind of bring the community together and everyone, while they kind of still dislike them don't feel like they have to buy them for some stat boost.The game at it's core is great, though. It has amazing music, sounds and overall premise but I just can't recommend the game even with a %50 sale on it. Wait till it has %75 sale on itself and all the DLC before buying it, trust me.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 18, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '319630', 'helpful': '3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""I've played a lot of games in my years.

It is to the point I felt happier playing the beta more than anything else.I have found myself confused as to how to progress, and in spite of being many levels higher of the mission in question at the time of writing this review I have been losing said mission in the last area due to extremely conspicuous bugs resulting in my death or falling through geometry.I cannot speak of the endgame because due to this mission I cannot reach it at all. It is so much I actually feel cheated because the beta was so much more fun to me, especially dark zone in the beta. I know referring to the beta as the better version may be seen as idiotic but it is genuinely how I feel.I cannot under any circumstances reccomend this game.

Since last reviewing this I have continued to improve and have found myself enjoying the game so much more. Warframe feels like a home, the game I always come back to after playing other games and it always has something to offer me.At this current time I own at least one of every warfame, either primed or non-primed versions, and have enjoyed playing them all. Note that most of my game experience has been had while playing as either Excalibur, Volt Prime or Frost Prime.I feel now that warframe is not only greatly customisable, and still Improving, that I feel I can now specialise myself in different ways. All my loadout slots have a speciality or an archetype. You may say I\'m limiting myself but this is how I choose to play. I said in my original review that there wasn\'t quite enough to specialise in, but I now feel otherwise.Something that feels perfect to me now is Warframe is getting more cinematic and lore friendly quests, mainly beginning with Natah, and I feel as though there is a much better narrative to the game, that while I did not feel it was required, I do love the addition of.The pay model is my favourite thing as it is basically ""Pay if you are not patient"" as it still seems to me that you can get everything you want, save maybe a few cosmetic items, by just playing the game and knowing where to be and when.To my favourite point about this game, Digital Extremes is still keeping me, personally, hyped. Usually what they add is something that I have been thinking ""Warframe would be so cool if it had X"" for example the upcoming weapon sheathing customisation. While a small thing to mention it does make me excited for almost every update, the only one letting me down being Sands of Inaros, but following such a big update as The Second Dream this couldn\'t really be avoided.Pros:A great game to play aloneA great game to play with friendsFantastic customisation to warframes and their coloursFun WeaponsFun WarframesEasy enough for new gamersChallenging enough for veteransCons:Conclave can be toxic (I do not blame DE for this one)Dark Sector as they are now, and as it seems they are to becomeNew Warframes appear to be stagnating slightlyOverall I reccomend Warframe to try, while it may take a while to really feel it you will feel like this game is everything you want.

There is no tutorial or anything to help you, well you wont really need any help because all your gonna be doing through the whole game is PICKING UP KEYS AND UNLOCKING DOORS!!!!! Where is the variety guys? C'mon....The maps are decent but not too special, and how come being a monster just really sucks!?! You would think that you would feel pretty cool being a monster but in this GAME you feel so cheap and pathetic. I was hoping you could do many cool things as a monster like trigger things, make people hallucinate and like fly around and drop in right behind a dude and scare the living daylights out of him. BUT NO! You can't do that, well atleast from my playthroughs I couldn't. As a monster in this game, you run around the area searching for people for hours and hours and hitting them then in one hit, they're dead. Very misleading... I wasn't frightened one bit in this game, the only thing I could say that scared me much was the freaking music that plays when a person is running away from you while your the monster, it just suddenly pops in, scaring the bajeezus outta you. But one poor decision that I hate in this game is that when your the lurker, you can't see anybody until you manifest. I find it very stupid but some people might disagree with me. Only my opinionAll I can say left about this game is that the premise of it sounds incredible but the dev's executed it poorly. I know it's in a earlier stage of development but still feels like a very VERY earlier version of the game that the dev's should only have. PLEASE DEVELOPERS LISTEN OUT!!!

Warface is a try-hard, want to be Call of Duty with clunky, awful gameplay whilst trying (and failing) to implement tactical features and functions. Warface also has one of the worst Pay-2-Win systems I have ever experienced and actually makes me cringe to the core. There is an in-depth review below but the bottom line is; Don\'t play it. In-Depth Review  Gameplay Like I said above, the gameplay is clunky and doesn\'t ""flow"" well. I often find that sprinting makes my screen clanky and jagged and when I shoot my weapon it seems too.....rough? Pardon my low-effecient vocabulary. Tactical Play (with some community banter) One of the tactical features in Warface is to help one of your poor-tasted buddies onto a higher ledge and vice versa. I don\'t think the Devs knew how sh*t their games community was going to be (hint: it\'s very similiar to COD, maybe even worse) These features seem tacky and useless, used just to add some ""innovation"" to their game. Pay-2-Win Never in my life have I played a game where I have to RENT an ingame gun and not have the choice to keep it permanently, despite all those hard-earned game duckets I spent on it. Note: I haven\'t played that much of the game and do NOT have a full understanding of the market system. EZ game EZ life I\'m really bad at Call of Duty, like awful, so I assumed that I would be bad at this also, that was until I went on a 15 kill streak in my first game. I know the majority of FPS is all just ""point-n-shoot"" but come ON FAM, THIS IS TOO EASY! Theres next to no recoil control or bullet drop, you can kill some nerd across the map with a couple of well placed bullets from the standard, beginner assault rifle and the slide feature allows any skirken to slide inbetween my legs and topple me even if he has awful aim NO SOUTH-PACIFIC REGIONAL SERVERS WTF!?!?! Crytek seems to think the world is a weird, pacman sort of shape because they apparently don\'t know New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa etc exist because they didn\'t create any f*cking dedicated servers for them, this is a personal issue but it should be resolved regardless of how bad the rest of the game is.

THE GOOD STUFF The gameplay is exciting, I often find myself on my toes, always alert for the ""Monster has startled the birds icon"" I couldn\'t wait to spring into action with my team mates. Playing as the monster is just as exciting, always on the prowl, sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful, the hunters become the prey.The classes the game provides (Assault, trapper, medic and support). Everyone has their own job and if one falls, the hunters may find it difficult to survive. The class system makes it important for Teamwork to exist within the game, making it a very good game to play with friends.Even on low graphics (had to turn it down due to optimization issues, more on that later) the game looks great, enviroments are lush and the dark, gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better THE BAD STUFF I\'ve read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game, even with powerful systems, admitedly my system isnt \'Top Tier\' but it\'s no scrap yard and I was having issues running the game on High, to get a smooth, enjoyable experience I had to turn the graphics down to Low. However I didn\'t expect much less, it is in Alpha after all.The loading times took ALONG time, I mean 10-15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level! I kept having audio issues, gun sounds repeatedly going off when I wasn\'t firing etc, quite irritating THE CONCLUSION It\'s good, its very good....FOR AN ALPHA, you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn\'t a full release, the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean, polished game out in Febuary.I highly recomend this, unfortunately I am writing this on the last day, I will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in, so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this.'}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted July 15, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited July 15, 2014.', 'item_id': '730', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Counterstrike: Global Offensive truly differs from the other modern AAA shooters that are released. PROS:-CS:GO has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters (Such as Deathmatch and Arms race) but keeps its core focus on the classic 5V5 diffuse mission that every Counterstrike fan knows and loves.-The game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates, which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to T spawn and a wall. But when you DON\'T have a team mate with the IQ of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team , whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends. Friendships are made!-The mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet, both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over time.-There is a wide variety of maps with ocasional DLC coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin cases.CONS:-The ""Valve Anti-Cheat"" doesn\'t seem to be working that well Gabe, now, this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you auto-connect to depend on your region (The oceanic reigon for yours truly). But I constantly run in to people with obvious aim-cheats, wall-cheats etc etc which really ruins the game.-I got a ban for ""kicking too many people in previous games""...excuse me? I consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and I understand that not everyone can 4K clutch, so I only vote to kick someone if they\'re doing worse than a BOT would or being a giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, in these cases, these players were being tremendous knobs (killing team mates, throwing the bomb into unreachable places, playing rap music down their microphone etc) Therefore I the teams I was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players, I just think the reason for the ban is a load of cack.-Aaah yes, Skin cases, now, I\'m not really considering this a ""con"" as its not Valves fault for making me spend that much money T.T only open cases/crates if you have the money! You will regret itDespite the couple of negative things I had to say, I give counterstrike a whole heartedly 9/10, if a game can make me as angry as this one can, it means it deserves a pretty solid rating. I recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning, this game is harder to learn than your average shooter, don\'t go in with the mind-set that you\'re going to wreck people in your first day, you won\'t, and thats good, its just the beggining soldier.'}]","['291480', '273350', '730']","['0', '2', '2']","[False, True, True]",0.6666666666666666

There is no other game in the entire universe, from now until the end of time that will compare to the greatness that is this game.You may say to yourself ""My my, this is a big claim you\'re making. Exactly what is it about this game that makes it so great?"". Well, let me tell you a story.Back when I was 11 years old, I was at school (bear in mind it was a rural area too, so there was lots of fields and farm animals around). I was in class, staring out the window, distracting myself from the boring lessons I had to endure. Sometimes, I would stare out into the fields and sky, contemplating what it would feel like to be out there, totally free to run around as a goat. I often pretended I was a goat at home, when I was alone in my beadroom, running around in circles destroying all of my toys, video games and things in my closet. This felt like it was representing the urge to release myself from the house I was living in and roam around in nature with all the other animals.For about 10 years since then, I was told to suppress my urge to become a goat. My parents didn\'t want to continuously purchase new toys and games for me to play with (which in hindsight was fair enough too, considering they would break every time I acted like a goat), and during that time, I felt alone. No one was around to understand how I felt. The urge to run around completely naked as a goat, breaking everything, was all but a distant memory, a shadow of my former self that I regretted to have. For a time, I nearly forgot about doing it at all.That was until this game came along.I played it, and played and played it. It changed by life. All the old feelings and urges came flooding back to me as soon as I started licking cars as they drive by. The wrecking of people\'s houses reminding me of those times as a kid when I would do the same thing in my bedroom. It felt like the developers truly understood how I feel, after all these years searching for someone who had the same hopes and dreams as me.As a result of playing this game, I have now started organizing meetups at night for likeminded people, and we run on all fours throughout the night, around the fields near my old school amongst other goats. Luckily we can get away with making goat noises when we\'re surrounded by them. No one seems to notice, thankfully. I hope, at one point, we can run through our nearest city as goats at some point, even if it\'s in goat costumes.And that is why I think this is the greatest game of all time. If anyone at Coffee Stain Studios reads this, I am personally thanking you for becoming an inspiration for me to create the new \'Goaty\' fandom.Sincerely,Bob'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 17, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '263100', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Absolutely sensational.That is all.'}]","['265930', '263100']","['2', '2']","[True, True]",1.0

THE FOOL!The characters were a strong point for the game, even if the acting sometimes fell short. Jenks was intelligent, calm and occasionally humorous. The rest of the cast appeared to have depth and real individual personalitles. At times it was a little frustrating as information i wanted to further investigate was brushed aside immediately after it was revealed. I also took exception to not being able to ask certain questions to avoid upsetting a character, i couldnt imagine a real detective sparing the feelings of possible suspects while attemepting to solve a possible murder. There were times that you would notice a contradiction between two characters but be unable to follow that obvious line of questioning. it was almost like them giving you vital clues but then shaking keys in front of your eyes as a distraction so you didnt solve the case too quick. It made the game feel as though you were looking for clues to progress the story and not looking for clues to solve the case. Kind of like being shown a giant tender steak cooked to perfection, with roasted vegetables and a small amount of mushroom gravy on the side but forcing you to eat multiple entrees made up of non delicious fillers, before sinking your teeth into that juicy rare steak. Using the map as a fast travel can stagnate your progress as walking through certain areas at times will trigger events that you may otherwise not travel to. They regualrly feel unimportant to your progress.Without revealing spoilers, the story couldve been rearranged in a fashion to make it fit together more smoothly instead of feeling like you've ignored vital pieces of information. I also feel that the game could have benefitted hugely from flashbacks.  I wouldve loved a chance to get to know the victim through story driven flashbacks as important  information was revealed. Maybe this was a budget issue for them and it was something they were just unable to include, which is understandable. It was a fun FMV detective game. But some small adjustments couldve improved the immersion immensly. mainly the organisation of the story and how in the timeline you were given certain bits of information. It really feels like they have opened some interesting oppurtunities if a second game was to be created.Overall it was an enjoyable game with potential to become a fun series, especially on the back of Inspector Jenks. While i do reccommend it, I do so hesitantly. I've attempted to explain what i found to be frustrating with the game and hopefully help you to make an informed decision before purchasing.""}]",['373390'],['2'],[True],1.0

After the Gordon Freeman, the character the player controls, reaches the test he is supposed to participate in he is immediately put to work. This has cataclysmic consequences, and Gordon Freeman is then forced to defend Black Mesa from an alien invasion and, eventually, the military, all the while being followed by the mysterious G-man.In terms of gameplay, Half-Life is very simple. You have health and suit power, a variety of guns and hopeully some aim. Starting with a crowbar and ending with a laser, you will shoot your way through Black Mesa, solving simple puzzles and navigating sometimes complex coridoors.The plot is simple yet effective, as is the gameplay.

Guided by an omnipresent voice, you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests.Although this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow, it most certainly is not. The main character, Chell, although mute, develops a personality regardless. An attachment is created with this voice guiding you. And, most cryptically, is the hidden areas in the chambers. These give background into Aperture Laboratories, the 'voice', and possibly the sole survivor.When compared to Portal 2, Portal does have some significant flaws. This include a lack of characters and personality which, although there, isn't built upon until later in the game. There aren't as many testing mechanics in the original, but this leads to much more creative test designes, requiring ingenuity over resources.Overall, this game is amazing, and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion. Portal 2 builds upon the first, and is a must after this is completed.""}, {'funny': '1 person found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted April 23, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '620', 'helpful': '2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Best game ever made, hands down.

The same characters are there, and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced. None of this is exactly game-changing, yet it does keep it fresh. The story lacks a little, which is mainly due to the lenght of the game.There isn't much to say for Episode One that hasn't already been said for Half-Life 2. While it is fun to fight alongside Alyx, it doesn't quite make up for the length of it. If purchased through the Orange Box, it isn't much of a problem.Overall, definitely worth playing, but only as part of the series, and not on its own.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 5, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '220', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""The sequel to the critically acclaimed Half-Life, Half-Life 2 breathes new life into the series.After the cliffhanger of the original Half-Life, Gordon Freeman is once again thrust into an alien invasion. This time, however, the invaders have effectively taken control of every resource and major population center on Earth. The prowess of the invaders is staggering, at least until Freeman manages to obtain another crowbar. After meeting with some old allies,  a terrible mistake exposes Freeman to the dictatorship in control of Earth, which leads to the mobilisation of all available units with the sole purpose of destroying Freeman.Without giving too much away, mayhem awaits.The plot of Half-Life 2 really is quite impressive, especially when considering that Half-Life had only a simple story. Half-Life 2 branches off from the original in an impressive manner, showing off the impressive writing talents of the Valve team. The plot is discovered through typical Half-Life fashion: your surroundings. While it's no Dark Souls in terms of plot, it doesn't obviously point out all the plot points, nor does it pause your game to tell you insignificant amounts of information.Gameplay in Half-Life 2 is similar to the original, except with a new arsenal and significantly larger environment. While restrained to the Black Mesa facility in Half-Life, Freeman is free to explore the world in the much largr sequel. This leads to more epic fights, environments and strategies.The new space is well utilised in most cases. Helicopters must be shot down, yet can do significant damage to any areas where you may hide. The Combine will attempt to ambush you whenever possible, which leads to surprises.The enemies and environment are impressive. The environment depicts what happens to Earth after being completely dominated by atechnologically superior force, and the aliens fit into areas apropriate for them, such asthe Antlions whom live under sand in beaches.Overall, I would say that Half-Life 2 builds on the original game in every way, yet it does not replace it. It creates an amazing world and great cast of characters that you will feel attached to, even the silent protagonist Gordon Freeman and the seemingly omnipotent G-man. I highly recommend this game, for its story, gameplay, characters and everything else that makes it amazing.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 5, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '213850', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""While I would recommend this game for someone who just wishes to play Magic in their free time, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who plays it outside of this.The pros of this game are the easy rulings and pre-built, satisfying decks.

Some would say that makes the game unbalanced but I see it as away to let new people to the game be on a fair playing felid with players who have had more time to play. Cards (spells) are unlocked as you level up, maps vary in size depending on how many people are playing. So far you can play 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1 & 2v2 online, with a spectator & offline mode also available.

The story follows a young man named Artyom as he travels through the dark and dangerous tunnels of the Moscow Metro while fighting for his life against mutants and bandits.Whether it is the darkness of the tight tunnels or the open space of the destroyed surface above, I simply love the atmosphere, I mean, it's similar to every other post-apocalyptic game that I've played, but this one just seems different somehow. Plus, tiny features such as cracks on the gas mask and the heavy breathing of the protagonist makes it even better. In my opinion, the only downside(s) of the video-game is the voice-acting - I'm assuming that they were trying to steer away from the stereotypical Russian accent or it's just me and my knowledge of Russian accents, but let's just ignore that. The frame-rate isn't the best either, there are times when it would dramatically drop then randomly rise again - I don't know about everyone else, but then again, maybe it's just me.All in all, I think it's an excellent game and to conclude this short review, I give it a 4.5/5.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 8, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited November 11, 2014.', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': '""Ah, Team Fortress 2, why are you so addicting?"" is what I say to myself all day - everyday. This excellent game is addicting and                           I                              mean addicting.I\'ve spent over 2000 hours on this game and I have no idea how I feel about that... but enough of random blab.Let\'s begin with... What is TF2? TF2 is a popular multi-player based hat simulator (ha ha, definitely an ""original"" joke), no story mode, no single player - unless you include practice mode and being on an empty server (which is unlikely depending on your location and the time you\'re on) - the community consists of hat-crazed people, weapon-quality crazed people and Gibus [crazed] wearers.In other words, the community is crazy. Crazy but fun, that is.Don\'t let the cartoony styled graphics drive you away from the game because they are actually quite nice and fit well with its 9 unique classes.So why should you get it, you ask? (Even if you didn\'t)IT\'S FREE TO PLAY! SO WHY NOT? Experience the game for yourself because you don\'t have to pay a single cent and if you highly enjoy the game, then you have the option to buy it and become involved in the crazy community of hat trading.Therefore, sit yourself down, get the game and waste many hours of your life on it - like the majority of us because I am certain that you will enjoy those wasted hours. I sure did. I think. Maybe. I still don\'t know how I feel. Anyhoo, I give a 5/5 for this fun-filled game. (Keep in mind that it can also be rage inducing).'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 8, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '550', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Have the urge to kick some zombie butt? Don\'t wanna be a loner in a zombie-filled world? Well then, Left 4 Dead 2 is the game for you. The concept of the game is pretty basic - join forces with three other players and beat up some zombies with a frying pan, or if you\'re tired of hearing the screams of dying infected - be the infected AND HEAR THE SCREAMS OF THE SURVIVORS INSTEAD. HA HA!Basically, if you get bored of playing as the survivors, the game gives you the option to fight against other players as 8 different special infected ranging from long-tongued Smokers and crying Witches to acidic Spitters and ""my vomit brings all the zombies to the yard"" Boomers, while some have their advantages and disadvantages, they are still very fun to play (sometimes). All I have to say is that L4D2 is one of my favourite games to play - especially with friends - and I want to emphasise the ESPECIALLY. Don\'t get me wrong, playing with random players is still pretty fun, but can be off-putting if they\'re too good and immediately overpower other players, including me (which happens quite a lot, but hey, what can I say? I\'m no pro at L4D2).Overall, I really enjoy this game and give this zombie-shooter a 5/5!'}]","['43110', '440', '550']","['0', '2', '1']","[True, True, True]",1.0

I paid $20 for this game, and I've played 90 hours so far and plan to play many more. First off - to anyone who says airdrops are pay to win, you are completely wrong. Your chances of getting a gun from a paid airdrop are almost as slim as your chances are surviving with the loot that actually drops from the crate - I managed to single handedly steal an airdrop from 3 guys because they weren't even watching, but I didn't get a gun anyway, only IEDs, moonshine and some swizzle. Another airdrop I saw only dropped things like a waist pouch and wooden tools. So if you do manage to get a SINGLE gun from an airdrop, you will have to be 1) extremely lucky to actually get an airdrop containing a gun 2) extremely lucky to actually get the airdrop and survive the zombies and attacking players3) extremely lucky to survive more than an hour with the single gun you got from a crate - WHICH IS AN ITEM YOU CAN FIND IN THE WORLD ANYWAYDOESN'T SOUND TOO PAY TO WIN TO ME, BUT ANYWAY.Okay, so now you should be fairly convinced that airdrops are not gamebreaking. This game, is fun as hell. I had nobody to buy this game with and have made many friends (and enemies) by just running around and talking to the whacky people found all around the lovely H1Z1 map. Most people will stop for a chat (unless you have a gun and they also have a gun, then they will probably shoot you) and you can always have a good time within a few minutes of spawning on a high population server.I have no idea where I was going with this review, but this game is fun. Really, really, really, ridiculously fun. I love shooting people in the head with an arrow. I love getting shot in the head with an arrow. I love blasting nerds away with a shotgun. I love getting blasted away by nerds with a shotgun. I love the zombies. The zombies hate me. I hate the bears. The bears, also, hate me.Who cares what this game turns into? It's a great way to spend $20 and it's fun NOW. The changes they have been making have only been good, and anyone who thinks this game will turn into a horrible monstrosity of a videogame out of nowhere are probably the same people that think Obama is in the Illuminati and will shoot into space in a super secret alien aircraft if the world goes downhill.Anyway, buy this game and we can have fun together. I might even shoot you in the face with an arrow.

Also, the missions are extremely replayable, so you will find yourself wanting to play again and again, to find different ways of completing each mission.This is an amazing stealth game, taking the previous games and transforming it into the ultimate open-world game.

The graphics are amazing (Althought there a certain features lacking eg ability to disable Depth of Field)The story is amazing, and packed with fan-service.

LEL-Heavy consequences. Attacks and Spells hurt.-Skill is rewarded, farming is more effective as 'gold generation' items don't exist (Hand of Midas is an exception and has a slow return rate)-More versitility through item system (not just sh*tty auras).-Has an actual warning/ban system that works (Get F*cked OCE LOL servers)-Limited wards, you can't simply have vision everywhere and never get caught.""}]","['440', '4000', '322330', '65800', '570']","['2', '1', '2', '1', '1']","[True, True, True, True, True]",1.0

The R&D to develop this game is commendable.Even on the hardest mode the game is very forgiving to maintain a high level of enjoyment.  The typical dumbness of the AI is refreshingly old school.  When struggling in a level I am able to use the limitations of the AI to ""cheat"" my way through.The flow of gameplay is at a great tempo.  The levels of varying degrees never get boring.  I love how the weapon selection resets depending on the story line & the upgrade tree adds that something that makes me replay this thing once I get through.The cutscenes are great.  A note to some with graphical issues - particularly with the win10 upgrade - do some homework on settings.For me, the changing of 3D settings helped a little but the main help was turning off power saving in graphic card general settings - watch a couple of youtube vids and the framerate picks up for this and other graphical games like FARCRY 4.For what the game delivers it is a big tick from me.

I am not critiquing the game, merely reviewing it.-In Risk of Rain you are a traveler on a space courier ship that\'s attacked by a mysterious... thing. Causing you to fall to the ground of an unfamiliar alien planet, where you fight for your life. Picking up items dropped by the ship and ultimately finding your way back to the fallen ship to fight the menace and leave the planet.When you first go into the game, you walk around the landscape and monsters will start to spawn, though slowly at first. You will then kill them, as they threaten your life, picking up their gold, which you then use to buy items out of the chests that have fallen down with you. When you first start playing, you will only have a small selection of items to find, but as you play more, you will unlock more, and these are persistant across lives. The difficulty increases over time, making monsters tougher and making them spawn more often, until you either die, or finish the game.  So, is it good? Hell yes. It definitely is fun to play. It has a nice growth curve towards the start, both with unlocking items through ""achievements"" -eg, kill 20 golems in one life, or activate the third teleporter without taking damage- and through increases in player skill, both with the game and with it\'s myriad of classes. Classes that, are unlocked through slightly bigger and harder versions of the achievements for items. -eg, kill 3 bosses or activate 40 drones in total.- It also has nice gameplay, that although slow towards the start of a game, gets progressively harder and faster paced as time goes on.Expect to die in your first few runs.The items are fun to use, with most of them providing unique effects that are not just simple stat bonuses. It\'s really refreshing. Having good items for your class is another challenge the game throws at you, as they all have different movesets with cooldowns as you use them, and different items will complement different classes much more than others. But of course, this all depends on what strategy you are using.Though there are complaints to be had.Risk of rain has a nasty thing called randomness, this can be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint. Some runs will be really easy, since you got good items from the -mostly- random chests, but others can be sabotaged by bad drops. Although I find that this can be overcome by player skill (and slightly balanced by the stat leveling system the game employs) this is a quirk of the genre that  can be good or bad. It makes the good runs stand out, certainly, but putting it the time to get there, at least initally, can be a slog. (I personally like it... now).The game is also short, but very high quality. Being a completionist, I have put a disproportionate amount of hours in. -More if you count the fact that I did most of the early game offline. It\'s not a big immersive rpg. It\'s a short sharp game you will play for, a week maybe, and will have you utterly hooked. it provides a unique blend of elements that makes it stand out and provide an experience like no other. You can keep coming back to it, sure, but it\'s not going to change much, and you will get bored of it eventually.UPDATE.Recently, however, there was an update the added artifacts that can change the game significantly, this can make the round you are playing unique to you and anyone else playing with you. This adds a new level of replayability to the game, making it last for much longer.I hope I\'ve provided some insight.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 22, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited December 22, 2014.', 'item_id': '274940', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""When I bought this game, I immediatly regretted all my life's decisions.But after I played my first game, I realised I was hangry for more.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 18, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '233740', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""It's fine for the first hour, then gets really, really boring.

Characters never seem to have enough ""Oomph\' in their attacks, as if they can barely hold up the weapon itself. The headshot mechanic is finicky and also not responsive (I may be wrong, but I found whenever I landed a decent hit to an opponent it would do damage, but not nearly as much as when you are poked in the face from a reeling attack from the opponent and are instantly defeated from it.)10/10 most unresponsive and difficult control scheme imaginable.Camera needs to be fixed, constantly becomes stuck on walls.

My computer can run heavily modded and graphically enhanced Minecraft, Dayz, etc, but 7D2D crashes.This isnt much of a problem as 7D2D closes instantly and only takes about 10 seconds to open up as it loads extremely quickly.What IS the problem is that THERE'S NO MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION, so if you find a gun, build a house and store supplies, it can crash without autosaving and send me back an hour. However I do have a 32-bit OS, which may be the cause of crashes I don't know.I WOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT HAS A MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION the lack of one is shocking in a game that rewards you for putting in time (e.g to contruct a fort, play around in creative, etc.) The autosave it does have seems to trigger at certain intervals, but there's no way to trigger it yourself or toggle it. And sometimes it works every 3 minutes, and sometimes it still dosen't work after 1 hour! That might be just my computer though.

Although in this game you are introduced to the monster quite early on. This game is also based on the creepy pasta character slender, if you didn\'t already figure that out, but this game changes it up so that he is not always behind you zipping around, but i won\'t spoil the actual mechanics because they are quite fun to play around with.Unfortunately this game does not handle well on weaker pc\'s so some people will not be able to see the marvel of the graphics, which in my opinion is some of the best i have ever seen in any horror game, second only to their original slender game- ""Haunt: the Real Slender game"". Also this is a free game, yesFREE GAME!Although it is still in its alpha/beta form so it may not be on final release so I suggest you get it while you can. Also you are only able to play the first episode: ""Haunt"", but episode 2: ""Welcome Home"", to my understanding,, will be available for purchase (sort of like the walking dead game, where you pay for each episode) in the near future.So I am looking forward to buying all the parts but i have yet to finish the first episode because i keep dying from slender man or the various glitches in the game (keep in mind it is still in alpha/beta) such as falling thought the world.I recommend you try out this game whilst it is free to see if you like it, but in my opinion it has a great atmosphere that i think not many recent horror games have been able to achieve for quite some time and i really enjoy playing it.'}]",['241640'],['2'],[True],1.0

The game's enviroment was a big plus for me. If you've played from 1 to Primal you'd realise the Farcry series is alot about the location aswell as gameplay. One thing I didn't quite get to begin with is that the game kind of throws you in and expects you to know what to do giving small tutorials on minor actions but no real perspective on what to do. If you've played 4 and 3 you'll see a pretty similar control scheme, so I'd say go into the game after catching up on your basic controls and you'll experience the game alot better. there are a bunch of new features to replace your old ones which I have a mixed opinion on so I'll leave that alone because nobody's opinion is greater than your own so If you want to experience the game for yourself.

Perks in the skill tress can be unlocked through skill points that you earn through leveling up by completing multiple heists.Technician(Specialise in trip mines and saws,great to bring along for bank heists or maps that have atms) , mastermind (passive and active perks , highly recommnded for those who think they might mess up stealth or specailise in crowd control), ghost(the skill tree says it all , its like the sneaky-ish class of the game where its perks allow you to be fast and silent while being able to hack and take out your enemies one by one) and enforcer(heavy weapons guy,no further explaination needed here).Depending on what playstyle or class you prefer most(you can invest in multiple skill trees , blending different playstyles) , this is going to determine what role you play in the team of 4 players(fixed at 4 every heist) .There are a few key mechenics in the game , which i will point out in a moment .1.CamerasOn most maps , there will usually be cameras scattered around the map which will sound the alarm if they spot you or your associates.These cameras are monitored by a camera guard in a locked room(such doors can be opened through high-level ghosts , drills or keycards if you are lucky enough to find one.In most stealth missions , we heisters take killing the camera guard as the main priority so that we can progress more smoothly .You can shoot out a camera to get a guards attention(this causes them to patrol around the destroyed camera,but not be alerted).However , on higher diffuculties , cameras are protected by a bullet-proof barrier(these cameras are called TiTan cameras) , making it even harder for the heist to be completed.2.Guards Guards spawn throughout different maps and differ from level to level , and will alert other guards and sound the alarm if they spot you , so keep a lookout for these guys.Btw , they also drop a pager after being killed ,and you are required to answer the operator over the pager by pressing f , so dont mess up a nice heist by forgetting to answer them.Guards on different maps also have different health levels(also affected by difficulty levels).3.Stealth I cannot emphasise on this any more than i ever could .STEALTH is the main playstyle of the game(my personal opinion)In most missions , on higher levels , people tend to restart when they are spotted and if he alarm is raised because the resistance is very strong (polica forces have more health ,as well has high dps weapons).SO KEEP TO STEALTH.Finally , what about the communty?Well , occasionally , there WILL BE d***s , however , for the most part , everyones friendly because everyone wants to accomplish that ONE common objective(beware of grenade trolling dough , cause i do those as well ;)  )Trolls will be trolls , haters will be haters , but we will all be hesters , so yes , STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME , AND PLAY IT NOW ,ALL PRAISE OVERKILLLLL""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted January 4, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited December 20, 2014.', 'item_id': '221100', 'helpful': '1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Be a hero , not a bambi  Heros get free beans'}]","['730', '218620', '221100']","['1', '2', '2']","[True, True, True]",1.0

Batman Arkham Origins is a prequel to the series and although it is not as revolutionary as the other two games I would say it is still a great addition to the series. This game features Batman meeting some of the Gotham super-villains for the first time such as The Joker, Bane, Deadshot and Black Mask. The graphics in this game are a step up from Arkham City and Batman has a new batsuit that looks more armoured. The combat remains the same with a few new gadgets such as the concussion detonator. The story is great, it starts with Black Mask putting a bounty of 50 million dollars on the death of Batman. Eight assassins take up the offer Bane, Deadshot, Firefly, Deathstroke, Shiva, copperhead, Electrocutioner and Killer Croc. I will not tell you more about the story for spoiler reasons but I can reveal that there is a massive twist. There are many bossfights and I must say they were all very good and polished compared to the Arkham City ones that were stun, beatdown,stun beatdown,stun beatdown, knockout. The one I enjoyed most was the copperhead bossfight when she drugged you and she made you see lots of her and you have to beat all the clones to harm the actual copperhead. This was reminiscent of the arkham asylum scarecrow fear gas hallucinations. There was a few bugs and glithches the first time I played through, one made me not able to complete the game, but these have been generally fixed with patches so it should be fine play right now. The multiplayer is a new addition to the series , which I did not have very high hopes for but it surprised me and I found I loved it. There are 3 teams 2v3v3 You are either Batman or Robin on one side and the other 2 teams are Joker\'s goons or Bane\'s goons. As batman or Robin you fly around, sorry glide around taking out thugs stealthily because only a few bullets can kill you, while you do this a meter is filling up for every takedown and if this meter is full then Btman and Robin win however this is very hard to do although it is fun silent takedowning (is that a word?) real people for once, not that I\'d do it in real life(I\'ve triedmit didn\'t work but I got a sharp slap from one of my brothers).The Gang\'s job is to capture posts and kill off the other team\'s reinforcement counter. If one of the gang\'s are killed off then the other gang wins.Once per game one person in the gang\'s will have a chance to play as Bane or The Joker which is also an enjoyable experience. Overall Batman Arkham Origins is very good. The game felt new at the beginning but then it just felt like a bigger Arkham city until you meet The Joker then it feels like a unique game again. WB Montreal has done enough taking over Rocksteady for this game to make it an enjoyable experience but some of the game just felt like the same S**t put into a new title but thankfully there was enough variation to make this game feel like it\'s own game although it is not revolutionary. If you liked the last 2 games you will love this game because it is more of what you love and then some. I give this game 7.4 out of 10. Thanks for reading and remember ""your batman"".'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 7, 2013.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited November 25, 2013.', 'item_id': '203160', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooo fun. not only is there a lot of action but there are a lot of puzzles in the game to break up the action. the only problem with this game is the mediocre multiplayer. it is open world and there are heaps of things to do.If I had to give this game a rating 8.5/10 for the singleplayer and 5/10 for the multiplayer. for only 30.00 on wow hd it is a great buy as well.'}]","['406150', '209000', '203160']","['2', '2', '1']","[True, True, True]",1.0

But enough about the development end of this game (High five to the developers though, you\'re fantastic.) Let\'s move on to the actual gameplay and mechanics of this game.To start with, you spawn somewhere on an Island (Future maps are comming out, also a moddable game so go nuts.) with nothing but the underwear covering your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and a chip in your arm. From there you punch a tree to get wood and thatch, collect rocks, and build your first primitive tool. After that the world is yours, if you wish you can go punch a Dodo in the face and make it your pet (Or if you\'re like me, you tame every Dodo you can find and amass an army to take over the Island. The Dodo King shall reign supreme!). It\'s very much a ""do what you wish, not what you have to"" kind of game. If you want you can climb the Tech-Tree, building newer and better things, but it isn\'t necessary, you can simply go around raiding other people for tools if you wish, or if you\'re smart enough, kill some dino\'s and they drop stuff. If you\'re too lazy for that, go find a cave and run for your life through it until you find a supply crate (Supply crates are drops that land around the world, they\'re always full of goodies.)This is by far one of the best games I\'ve seen on Steam in many many years, if you haven\'t bought it, do it now.

Or perhaps you wish to nuke Israel, get payback against China or even re-establish the apartheid in South Africa. This game really challenges you to make the future different, although it isn't THAT realistic, it still is fun. However, there are some issues, the saddest part of this game is that the company that made it, went bust (to my knowledge) so there will be no chance of a sequel unless another company picks it up. Also reports of widespread bugs that make the game unplayable, which is sad, the only patch, the 1st patch, was released, and you can expect no other updates.Overall I recommend it, it's heaps of fun, and for me, it works well.

This game is a fast pace third person moba game wahtever its called and its really fun. the background commentary is quite funny and sometimes quite useful. The background commentary also never repeat in my experiences. For low levels it is really hard to find matches meaning you have to make a customs matches with higher level people which mean you either lose horribly or get carried in most moba games. Another down note it has a lack of players meaning if you dont want to make a custom match with randoms and want to solo queue it will take about 30 mins+ for people level 1-19. Some positive notes the classes are balanced and none are really that OP however the diffcult pros are really weak if you dont know how to play the class. I find that once your under level you really cant catch up useless they become monkeys are lose the game on purpose.    IN CONCLUSION: This game is FUN as it is really unique to the games we currently have now. However mirco transactions are really pricy and lack new players. I recommend that they should add more customization and reduce prices on mirco transactions to somewhat a $1 USD for taunts and things. They should also improve matchmaking with randoms and make more servers cause they only have 3 regional servers Australia,North america and Europe. i recommend that people should pick this game up since it is Free.

Possible suggestions: Glock 18 (it is common with the Police Force, this makes it acceptable), Sig Sauer P226. I am not requesting you put any fully-automatic AK47's and M4A1's, or a powerful Barret M82A1. Because I believe they would be way too overpowered.

After playing at different settings and resolutions to test out the program I can conclude that I did not experience a significantly noticeable FPS gain with the software. However, I did notice that the FPS was much more stable and there weren't as many jitters and screen tears when there were lots of action. Personally, I think I didn't gain as much from this software because even though my CPU is old, it is more than capable of running CS GO at any setting. The bottleneck is probably caused by my GPU. However, I believe that this program will definitely benefit users if they have a dual core CPU or suspect their CPU is bottlenecking their GPU. If you have a relatively weak CPU I encourage you to give this a try because even if it doesn't make a difference you can always get a refund.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted April 1, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '225080', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Very relaxing game'}]","['384300', '225080']","['2', '0']","[True, True]",1.0

However I'd still say that the original BioShock was alot more entertaining.I was slightly disappointed that BioShock Infinite didn't live up to expectation set by developers in early production. Even elements shown in the Beta game-play seemed to be non-existent: such as being fired at with artillery weapons and having a telekinesis power to stop the shells, sandbox level design, larger and more open areas and the random collapse of buildings as well as random weather events. However due to time, story and technology restraints many of these features were unrealistic so many of this is excusable - yet still leaves me mildly disspointed.Also I found the ending to be a bit weak, but enjoyable none-the-less. The re-playability is also somewhat non-existent do to the linear level design that isn't present in the previous BioShock games that would have left you searching through every corner of the map in the hope that you may have missed something. I still strongly recommend playing the game.

Cards have different rarities, the rarer, the more perks you have.Higher rarity also changes the cosmetics of your character, ie: different camo on clothing and weapons.Cards can be traded up for several cards of the same rarity plus a small amount of credits.Each character has 3 different primary and secondary and knives which you might get.Each character has different roles because of their weapons and equipment, and a different card (loadout) may change your playstyle because of the weapons or perks, etc.There are 2 mercs which are permanently unlocked, and some mercs you can play as or a limited time because of free-rotation, which cycles mercs every few weeks. You can permanently unlock Mercs with either ingame credits, or cash.This certainly isn\'t pay2win, because if you buy a merc, other people may be able to use it in a few weeks.It only takes about 6-10 hours of playtime to be able to afford a merc with ingame cash anyway.You can aim down sights, but it is not reccomended as there is nearly no (extreme) recoil, and it slows you down.Time to kill in this game is considerably long if you go for body shots, which is why headshots are always reccommended, as it\'s only 2-3 shots with an AR.Pros and Cons.Pros:-Attractive visuals-F2P, but buying things with cash does not give an unfair advantage-Accessible game with a high skill ceiling, easy to learn but hard to master-Free rotation mixes up gameplay-The game has ""under level 5"" servers for people new to the game-You\'re able to walljump twice and keep momentum, making awesome trick jumps and skill based movement possible-Gun play is great-Hitboxes seem fineNegatives:-Some maps and classes need tweaking, ie: longer cooldown for airstrikes-Lack of gamemodes and maps-The game requires a lot of communication and team work for your team to be successful.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 31, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '219640', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Pros-Fun combat-Different clasees and weapons can completely change the playstyle-Wide variety of period weapons, including: Generic swords (short sword, broad sword, etc), Spear, Claymore, Billhook, Zweihander, Axes, Maces, Morning star.-Sharp learning curve-Easy to grasp, but hard to master combat-Nice maps and graphics-Plenty of blood and gore, including decapitations-Servers that only new players (<level 15) can join to learn the game before joining regular servers with more skilled players-Objective modes are fun and challenging, Push the cart, Destroy X, Kill the King, etc-You have a warcry button to scream while charging into battle-Polished game-Cheap on sale, 2.49 USDCons-Some weapons need minor changes to balance them'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 31, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '242760', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Pros-Beautiful graphics-Large map-Really fun with friends or just other players-Difficult but fun and rewarding gameplay-Regular updates-Good building and resource mechanics-Good crafting systemCons-Horrible memory leak, my Fps starts at about 90 when I first start playing and after a few hours I can start going as low as 20 FPS-Can sometimes have trouble joining Co-op games-Annoying glitches, bonfires become unlightable-Hard to remove buildings after they've been constructed-Hard to lineup and make level and square buildings with custom foundations, floor, walls, etc-Hackers will often join your games and spawn hundreds of logs or other items, as there is no VAC and/or 3rd party anticheat-Some caves are nearly empty and feature no loot other than food""}, {'funny': '2 people found this review funny', 'posted': 'Posted December 4, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '212480', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ' ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñå‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñê‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñê‚ñàU HAVE BEEN FASTED BY ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñå‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñÑTHE FAST MASTER‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñå‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñå‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñå‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñê‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñê‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñê‚ñà‚ñà‚ñå‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñí‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñê‚ñå‚ñë‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñà‚ñå‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñà‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñå‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñê‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñë‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÄSEND THIS TO 7 OTHER PEOPLE OR UR TOO SLOW!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 6, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '4000', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Great game - New gamemodes all the time.

The story is well-written, and honestly, it prompted me to reflect on the value and shortness of life. It's a short visual novel, but it powerfully evokes emotions in the brief time we get to know the protagonist and Setsumi, whose lives are made brief due to their respective illnesses. Though the characters are distant at first, there is an intimacy between the them that develops which was touching and the soundtrack and voice track simply enhance the experience. For a doujin work, the artwork is quite well done and the minimalistic approach of presenting the setting and characters allowed me to have a more personalized experience with the story. The rare moments when I actually got to see the Setsumi's face actually felt precious. I really liked this approach. However, I did notice some inconsistencies with some of the art, but it was not terribly noticeable.It's a touching story about two terminally ill patients who are unhappy with their situation, who go on a search for a place that they can die peacefully.

I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 2+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun""}]",['440'],['2'],[True],1.0

You may want to let the excitement die down and the developers to adress many things, even for a die hard wh40k and shoot emp up fan. Latest edit - - - The gap has become pretty much impossible to close now, even while it is obvious players from the spacemarine side has been wising up.Chaos ground assault is chosen like a zerg class as every objective favors close range combat, which is not fun to play against and with. with the recent addition of chain axes which go through GA spacemarine shield, Chaos is 99% guarantee to win a match with rude chaos players gloating at the same time they run the same cheap GA zergs. At this time, I have changed my scoring recommondation to negative, steer clear of this game. Maybe wait for it to go into full release before purchasing, maybe once the player base starts to die, they can contemplate the massive complications that make playing this game extremely dissatisfying.

All other means of playing the game can be extremely difficult or impossible to have fun with save for singleplayer for people like me who are also just fine with solo play. Solo play\'s novelty does not wear off completely at play times, but it quickly dissipates until you can find it palatable once again.The following are personal opinions from multiplayer:Open servers can be divided between two categories: - Tame PVE servers that provide little opportunities for new players as nearly all sustainable locations are gratuitously occupied in large scales by a small percentage of older players by placing one piece of cheap fort structure to expand vacant and useful locations. Lack of available and sustainable locations to start means you will as a new visitor of an existing server will often die too fast before you are able to make any meaningful progress save for a grindey levelling system that is only made less fun and more time consuming by the limitations imposed by other older and more wealthier players.- Hostile PVP servers where the same problems of PVE exist and where new players will get targetted almost guarantee. Dying to both other players and other entities increased in magnitudes. Earlier and more established player groups dictate the meta and the limitations of new players or those who wish to play the game for its mechanics and less for the meta dictated by others. Much like real life, in order to have ""fun"", or rather function in this digital society you need to join tribes to succeed, but not in your own terms. There is nothing wrong with team play, but you will have to learn to be completely subservient to a few and be constantly worried about their ""authority"" (and beyond just common manners and courtesy not to mess with other people\'s stuff) in public server.I recommend that if you are intent with multiplayer online, find private ones. Most of the time they tell you quickly how the server operates and is much less of a wild west. If it\'s a PVE server, they are often not as populated and more space to enjoy yourself, and pvp, not really much difference to public server. If pvp is your deal, then the value proposition is there.Can\'t recommend it to a few, but neither can I tell others to avoid the game completely.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 10, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '6060', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Fun tymes to be had,'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 5, 2011.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '440', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'A memorable game that you will someday jabber about to your grand-children'}]","['375230', '346110', '6060', '440']","['2', '2', '2', '1']","[False, False, True, True]",0.5

It‚Äôs very reference heavy and joke heavy in a large part thanks to Meme Overlord Nep. You‚Äôll feel like a massive weeaboo and lose respect of friends and/or family but at least you‚Äôll have fun doing it. Pick up the game if it‚Äôs on sale, it‚Äôs worth it even if to just try the style and the franchise. I will say though I have started mk2 and its combat is the same and fairly repetitive.  So where do I start with the Neptunia? It's an amusing game, that's for sure and to sum it up it's more or less references to other games the game. For starters place names are named after consoles or based off places in other games. Monsters exist that look like the enemies in space invaders or like Kyubey from the Madoka Magica anime. Items have names from the final fantasy games. Throughout dialogue there are vague references (vague for copyright reasons I would assume) to consoles, people involved with games, websites, anime, manga and I doubt anyone would pick up on all of them, it's actually pretty good. I've been told that the later games actually get a more references, memes and typical game tropes thrown into them and that is amazing.  Positives   Interesting and likely to get a giggle now and again.  Cute and quirky ‚Äúanimu grills‚Äù doing ‚Äúcute things‚Äù If that‚Äôs your style and you‚Äôre down for that.  Did I mention the insane amount of references and jokes the game makes relating all sorts of ‚Äúgeeky‚Äù things?   I feel like the word Nep could be used like the word Smurf was and that relacing any verb with the word Nep will make it an innuendo. (Just me? Okay.)   English dub is actually very, very good.  Nep-Nep sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare on levelling up sometimes and it‚Äôs amusing.  Nep is bit of goof ball  and MEME OVERLORD  making for a funny experience.   Good sense of humour.   Negatives    It is a huge grind from start to finish it feels. After the first half of the game you really get tired of the grinding and need up put it down.  There are ways to speed up the grind to your desired speed however, I won‚Äôt mention it here; I‚Äôll leave that up to you to look into.   Cringe factor is a thing. Rarely something gets said and you just go ‚Äúohhf yeah, no‚Äù  Holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• do I feel like a massive weeaboo playing this game sometimes.  Your friends will deffinantly think you‚Äôre a massive weeaboo for owning it.    It‚Äôs difficult at times unless you have the DLC. In which case sadistic Plutia will wreck everyone.

I‚ÄôLL MAKE THE FIRST PART AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE THEN LATER ON MENTION SPECIFICS WHICH MIGHT BE SPOILERS. I have waited‚Ä¶. SO long for this book, to finally play it has been great and really happy to finally get an ending to the story. So, storyline. The story line is mostly great, to summarise it you have two worlds one of magic, one of science and both can be affected by each other and I won‚Äôt mention exactly how because you know, spoilers but yeah it‚Äôs interesting. I really loved the fact you have 2 worlds and one semi world/ in-between world? Anyway these three worlds you play in and eventually they begin to merge then finally they all meet at one point. Look, as of writing this it‚Äôs on sale for about US$10.20 which, if you‚Äôre paying in Australian dollarydoos or Canadian Maple Money/ Monopoly money is a bit more than that but at that it‚Äôs worth it to play the story.  Things I really liked    I loved the fact you could examine just about anything(Because I‚Äôm a nosey ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I suppose) and get a character‚Äôs thoughts and at times humorous dialogue or little bits. For example, examine a rocket and get character dialogue of ‚ÄúGround control to Major Tom!‚Äù Nice touch. Makes more sense given the rough era the area is based on.  I like the fact choices do seem to matter, think of it like a stat check. A string of choices could have an affect later and a couple times I found myself thinking ‚Äú‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I made a bad decision last book. Bad things are going to happen‚Äù That or regret a decision after it was made.  The scenes are pretty beautiful. Especially europolis, it‚Äôs always dark and rainy. Your apartment is small but still very beautiful and I just love that city and contrasting medieval style city. Very nice.  The characters are great. I especially like Zoe, Enu, Mira, Crow and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Bot. Specifically Enu, she is so ditsy and cute and awkward.   Miner dislikes/ gripes  It could be a little slow sometimes to go from place to place just to do something seemingly simple.  It would have been nice to see more of some characters to really get more of a feel for the world and be more engrossed within it.   Now, I‚Äôd just like to chuck on some quotes form the game I found particularly amusing before the small spoiler section down below later.   ‚ÄúI need to be in that body. And I need to stop sounding like a pervert.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAffirmative. I will stop doing this thing that I live that makes me happy and fulfilled to follow you on our pointless, depressing journey. ‚Äú ‚ÄúRequests for sexual favours will be bogged and reported to the appropriate authorities. WATIcorp adbots do not ‚Äòtalk dirty‚Äô or perform fellatio.‚Äù  ‚ÄúEvery step you take‚Äô I‚Äôll be watching you, as mandated by martial law.‚Äù ‚Ä¶.. ‚ÄúHow about every breath I oh I give up‚Äù  MOVING SLIGHTLY INTO SPOILER TEROTORY NOW FOR BOOK 5 AND POTENTIALLY PRECIDING BOOKS Things I really liked (cont)     symbolism maybe?  I‚Äôm not up with Buddhism or things within it but in book 5 Zoe comments on the ‚Äúbetween world‚Äù place being like a Buddhist temple. Might be some form of a reference to something from Buddhist beliefs but not sure.  The choices I made meant that in the story line I made good with people. And I‚Äôm so glad I did, just a few different decisions and maybe that wouldn‚Äôt be the case.

TL;DR:  If you‚Äôve played the first game then this is an amazing continuation to that. The characters see more development and are put into a situation where they see a different frame of view. This felt better paced to the first one and you get more of the journey with party, there are no choices but that‚Äôs to be expected. It‚Äôs a story being told.  It‚Äôs not all that common for a game to leave me with a lasting feeling for it. A lasting impression almost like being heartbroken due to the impression it left and the feelings it left me with. Fault milestone one didn‚Äôt do this to me as much although it was a great game, just a little prolonged for my tastes but I love the story. There are no options in this, it‚Äôs a story so expect reading.IF YOU HAVEN‚ÄôT PLAYED ONE THEN PROBABLY SHOULDN‚ÄôT READ PAST HERE BECAUSE SPOILERS. So two starts where one left off being confronted by one of the badies from the start of the first game and from that point the story continues. The story of two follows the journey of Ritona, Rune and Selphine as they continue their travels. In terms of the story, it‚Äôs great and I love it. The characters get some more development and are places outside of everything they are used to and put them into a different frame of mind. Rune, from the world of science (and steampunk?) gets to see the magic world. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt get to see a lot of Ritona this chapter and I would really like to know her story but no matter. Most of the interaction in this story is between Rune, Selphine (while in Empress Syndrome you see at the end of the first game) and characters they met in their journey. As far as the art and story goes it‚Äôs great, the sound fits the game although I turned it down a fair bit otherwise it‚Äôs just too loud for me. The art is amazing as it was and I really like the CG events in this game a lot. Personal feelings on this are I just love the story, the pacing was better than it was in the last game and the story was something that if I had the time I could just sit down and play through in one sitting. This really left a heavy feeling in my heart and left a lasting impression emotionally. I love the concepts shown in this world and also the stark difference between the inner and outer poles. I can‚Äôt wait for the third game.

This game is amazing amounts of fun and it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs really solid for a free game and I like a lot of others must ended up buying something from the store. I have 4 characters and 3 of them at the level cap, I just got so addicted to playing this game.  Positives:    This game is free. Holy crap. I would encourage anyone to at least try it for that.  Despite constantly high ping the game played just fine for me.  Pretty much everything you can buy with real money can be bought with in game gold too so if you can afford to buy stuff in game you don‚Äôt have to spend any IRL money.  I was able to create a guild called Westside Weeaboos and that‚Äôs the best thing ever.  want to be a cute elf girl?  I know I sure do. Heh.  Then this is it, create and customise your perfect doppelganger That looks nothing like the real you lol nerd   People are reasonably helpful and nice at least of PvE servers I played on. Sometimes you get some salty people when you party for end game dungeons though.   Negatives:    No servers outside of Europe and North America. I believe there used to be an Oceania server at one point but not anymore. Despite that though the game generally played very well.  A lot of busy work so things like fetch quests and kill this type quests. Which is something most MMO‚Äôs suffer from.   I don‚Äôt know if I like this or not but skill specialisations exist where you can only specialise in one thing at a time meaning you need to rely on guilds, market or friends to craft items to use in your specialisation.

The casual modes allow players to play a variety of game modes in a non-competitive way. So, why the negative review? The ranking system has severe problems and the community can be toxic at times. So the problems:    Smurfs  ‚Äì not a lot of fun to play with. Higher skilled players getting kicks from kicking the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of lower levelled players.   De-rankers and trolls  ‚Äì can be Smurfs trying to drop pack again through ranks or someone getting kicks from being annoying. Can‚Äôt votekick if 2/5 players on your team are doing it.   Hackers  ‚Äì I don‚Äôt come across these as regularly as some do but still very annoying.   Bad community  ‚Äì if you have a 5 person team you might be okay. Playing solo it feels like a gamble; sometimes you get friendly people in teams and other times abusive people.  Plenty of 12 year olds have had sex with family so they claim. Also, never heard the words ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and etc. used more than in this game. So why do I have so much play time? The game itself is good to play and when you win it really is satisfying. The issue is mostly some people who ruin it for others. However, it can be fun and casual is always an option if competitive becomes too much.

Can‚Äôt speak for the keyboard controls as I use a controller but in terms of the game itself the time concept and the open world nature FINALLY back to an extent is very refreshing to see again. The game play is fun and the story is not as deep as other games but still a good game, just a shame it didn‚Äôt get much development. Really love lightning as a character but the whole emotionless all the time though got annoying but well play the game and see what happens. If you haven‚Äôt played it then may be worth playing if you want an end to the XIII story and played the other two but overall I didn‚Äôt mind it. Just I‚Äôve played it on PS3 already when it was out. Only got the steam one because it was pretty cheap on sale. Positives:   The successor to XIII and XIII-2 and how the other two games should have been.  Finally open world again allowing for doing things pretty much however you want with the exception of time based events.  The time concept was an interesting one. And for those who find it annoying just keep using Chronostasis. When I played it on PS3 I stopped for awhile and totally forgot about that ability and ran out of time. But using that ability you pretty much never will run out of time.  Lighting dress up simulator.  Negatives:   Found myself doing a lot of grinding for items or quests. But that‚Äôs what I expected having played the PS3 version upon release.  The depth of the story was a little bit disappointing. I was hoping for a super expansive story and universe after XIII was a little bit of a flop. XIII-2 improved a little but while LR was good, it wasn‚Äôt the bound I was hoping for.  occasional cringy dialogue.  Time sink. Loss of productivity for awhile ‚Ä¶  Loss of self-respect.

This is a great build and gather type game, think of it like 3D Terraria in space. You can play in a sandbox where you can build structures to your hearts content or in a survival type mode where you must gather resources in order to build things. The game is pretty fun with other people and the community support means you can get blue prints and mods that can be added without messing around with a third party mod manager. There have been a few bugs along the way but the developers are pretty good with fixing those as they know about them (The game is early access, after all). The base maps are pretty solid too.

It\'s purely atmospheric horror and It doesn\'t just rely on cheap scare tactics like jump-scares and loud noises like other survival horror games.Now on to the survival aspect of The Forest, I personally think this part was really well done, it actually makes you adapt and survive! From not being able to eat raw meat and actually having to put it onto the fire and wait for it to cook so you don\'t burn it, to simply how the tree cutting animations are and finding berries that are not poisonous to eat.At the moment it\'s pretty buggy. But what do you expect from a pre-alpha? I\'m really looking forward to seeing what Endnight games can do with The Forest in the future. This game would easily be Game Of The Year for me, normally I wouldn\'t even fathom choosing a game like this for GOTY, but The Forest is just perfect to me, and can definitely see this being one of my all time favorites.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted May 28, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '262410', 'helpful': '12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a really in depth firearm simulator. Mostly in the way you pull apart the guns piece by piece but there is a firing range and operation mode where you can fire the gun of your choice with different attachments such as silencers, scopes, different magazine sizes and just learn how every single component works with each other. The satisfaction you get when you pull apart and put back together a sophisticated gun with more than 60 parts without choosing the wrong components is probably more rewarding than shooting the gun itself. The only downside to this game is that it's a bit grindey, but I guess that adds to the charm of getting to know each and every part of the weapon you are disassembling, but it's not too much of a problem for me as I don't really mind a bit of a grind sesh once in a while. Plus I get time to learn every weapon that is in the game instead of just blazing past every single gun and missing out on how they all work.In conclusion, it's MUCH better than the Google Play and Apple store versions just because of the fact you have full control over the camera. Plus it's a stupidly fun and rewarding game if you're into pulling things apart then putting them back together just to see how they work and operate.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 31, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '238280', 'helpful': '22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Legend Of Dungeon is most probably the best rouge-like/lite I have ever played.There is so much of these style games but there's something about this game that just hits the nail on the head, I'm not sure what it is but something about it that just stands out from the rest, even with how basic the combat is. (one click button attack, hold to do power attack) There is a fair few weapons to come across from the mighty code hammer to the speedy coffee mug. There's also some pretty cool easter eggs from some of my favorite movies and games that i won't spoil.There is a really decent amount of different monsters to encounter too, from bats, annoying as hell goblins and slimes to minotaurs, cyclopes, Succubs and the crazy OP lich king. The randomization of this game is really well done too, it actually feels like luck based randomization unlike other rouge-likes/lites which you are more or less guaranteed to get better loot straight after spawn. On one playthrough I walked out of the bar/pub onto the first floor and got destroyed straight away by a cyclops, then on another run I found the code hammer on floor 3 and got to level 19.Plus the lighting, colors, interesting pixel art is like the cherry on top for me.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted March 31, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '248820', 'helpful': '7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Risk Of Rain is a brilliant platformer/rouge-lite, the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily I can switch from being under-powered to over-powered and then back again in split seconds. (mostly from getting too cocky when I have certain power-ups. :P) It's genuinely a hard game and I love it for that reason. The music is a selling point as well, sort of a rocky/electronic/ambient thing.The difficulty scales just right for me, it gives me a good 2-5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level, so I can do either a quick pick-up-and-play run or i could do a good 40 min run to (rarely) get to the last level. Plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power-up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone.The only gripe I have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends, when I want to connect with a friend I have to use a program called Evolve[evolvehq.com] that gives me and my friends a temp IP address, and even that fails some of the time.All in all, this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list.""}]","['242760', '262410', '238280', '248820']","['2', '2', '2', '2']","[True, True, True, True]",1.0

Audio is great, your radios will allow you to talk with the rest of your squad, however if you say something when an enemy is close, they can hear you also... The only improvement I would like to see is the ability to change the radio volume separately to the rest of the ""sound effects"" volume. Player voice chat is controlled seperately to sound effect volume.Differences to most shooters:1. Respawns. Depending on the mode, you will run out of respawns in different ways. Some maps give your team a limited number of respawns that you can replenish by capturing/destroying objectives. Other maps only will respawn your team when you capture or destroy an objective. Other maps you get given a limited number of respawns and can\'t replenish them. This makes the game MUCH more team-based, as by yourself you will die quickly2. Health. You don\'t regenerate it. You will often die from only one or two bullets, and you often have very little idea where you were shot from. This makes your individual tactical approach, as well as your teams strategy, much more important. If you run in the open, you die quickly. 3. Weapons. You get ""supplies"" which are used to purchase weapons and upgrades. You can fit different sights, ammunition, barrels, grips and accessories to weapons, you can purhase different types of armour and grenades.  You often need to balance what you want, as you don\'t have enough supplies to get the best of everything. Capturing objectives can give you more supplies.The only thing that I really dislike about the game is that there are some ""restricted areas"" where the game prevents you from being able to shoot. This is designed to keep you playing near the objectives, but sometimes can be painful as you cannot visually see where they start or finish, so sometimes you will run for cover and find yourself in an area that you can\'t defend yourself in.Overall a fun game with a steep learning curve and something I would recommend to any other FPS fan.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted June 17, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '275670', 'helpful': 'No ratings yet', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'Great gameSimilar to the ""Galaxy Trucker"" board game where you have to design your ship and go through missions, with some significant differences.1) you must place a number of ""cargo"" peices, and usually one engine peice prior to launch.

It is a well designed and coded game.Suggestions for the dev, maybe have a DLC where you can modify the shape of the ship, and take it through longer/harder missions.

Graphics are great especially the wireframe view, and the controls are fairly easy and intuitive. Sounds are pretty good also especially the main menu soundtrack. Going through career mode is enjoyable but I can\'t imagine myself playing it again for quite a while.As far as gameplay goes, it looks to be aimed at a fairly beginner mechanic to a hobbyist. If you know how to strip an engine down and rebuild it I probably wouldn\'t recommend it. I know the main concepts of how all the parts of an engine work, however I still learnt a bit from this game, and it is still keeping me entertained. There is a few annoying things (like having to remove the airpipe, then 4 bolts and the airflow meter, then another 4 bolts for the air filter cover, before being able to see the air filter) but this is minor.It starts off where all the engines are 4 cylinder front wheel drives, then after about 15 or so missions it slowly introduces you to more (4x4\'s, 6 cylinders) and it starts from basic problems ""replace my brake pads"" to ""my boss told me to bring the car to you but i have no idea what you need to fix"" type jobs. After playing about 40 missions, I\'m still enjoying the game (especially the dyno-tuning mini-game) and i really hope they bring out a more detailed and more complex version next year. I\'ll definately buy it. I would like to see the ability to ""hear"" and ""feel"" problems (ie: when driving around the test track) or being able to negotiate my own price with the customer (maybe ringing them up halfway through a job saying ""this is also broken, want it fixed?"" or ""i can do this cheaper if i use 2nd hand parts"". I would also like to see more types of engines (maybe trucks, rear-mounted engines, motorbikes).All in all, its a good game, and i\'m stopping this review now so i can go and play it more...'}]","['49520', '222880', '275670', '243870', '92800', '270850']","['2', '2', '2', '0', '2', '2']","[True, True, True, False, True, True]",0.8333333333333334

I was playing with one of my friends and we found each other after about those 3 hours, I learnt the basics of the game within that time and managed to make a starting weapon and go on to hunting.Ok rust has issues and bugs here and there, but although it is only in alpha it is one of the best games i have played, on my second realtime day of playing rust i made 2 new friends and next thing you know we all built together hunted together and ofcorse raided less fortunate players together.My most memorable moment is when me and this group of mine we all sprinting through the pitch black night, armed to the teeth with weapons, armor and explosives, all you could see were our lazer pointers and flashlight atatchments, we arrived at a base 5x the sive of ours and with many c4 explosives we broke through and found the mother of all loot, we killed the people that were asleep and destroyed their sleeping bags, Harsh? we know, but after playing rust for a couple hours u will relise its survival of the fittest.Overall 20$ for a game that is only in alpha stage and has so much potential??? i think so, u would be insane to pass this offer.'}]",['252490'],['2'],[True],1.0

And after playing the game, I still wouldn't suggest buying the game for $10US.There's plenty of good things about the game, the sound track is amazing, some of the characters are endearing and the boss battles are decently varied and offer a modest challenge.I liked how they tried to do something different with the battles, but outside of the boss battles the bullet hell games aren't fun or exciting after you've encountered them once (and you'll encounter them repeatedly, thanks to the laws of Random Encounters in JRPGs).However the vast majority of the game is simply... vast. Empty space as far as the eye can see.The overworld is plain in the visuals, composed of a TON of black space with nothing to provide any sort of visual stimulation. The 'puzzles', which are touted as a large portion of the game, and are frequently referenced by characters in game, are lackluster, unchallenging, time-wasting and unsatisfying. A few characters are absolutely delightful, but in a game that has about 8 main characters, 3 of them I found endearing, 2 were bland or just tolerable, and 3 were downright annoying.The art style is very inconsistent when it comes to several of the characters. I know this was a game made by several people, but when one character looks detailed and in depth and another looks like they were drawn in MS paint it makes me wonder if these were just placeholder characters who the developers never playtested through and realised they needed to fix, or if it was just laziness on their part.On all I enjoyed the destination, the ending of the game was refreshing, but the journey was a horrible bumpy road along a stretch of empty desert in a car with an annoying dog that pukes once every few minutes.Overall I absolutely adored 30% of this game, and didn't like 70% of the rest.

So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted July 31.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '271590', 'helpful': '2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""Don't bother.

Anniversary has more colours, shadows and details- It is moddable- It does have ALL TLC's DLCS included in it.- They did add new equipment to this game such as  Snowspire Guard Outfit and the Jackarse- It has the new difficulty that makes this game a bit challengingCon:- For anyone that have played TLC, they won't see any differences in it.- No mouse support in the menu and inventory.

They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the ""Housing"" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The ""Homestead"" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone\'s Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing""Rebirth"" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your ""combat"" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme? Done.If you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.Server: TarlachMy in-game name: Alyxa'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 14, 2014.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '33930', 'helpful': '7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': ""Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.Now for me, the Singleplayer is quite challenging, the AI are quite powerful and strategic, and extremely lethal.They can easily kick my butt which literally forces me to think of different strategies to try and defeat them instead.The bonus with Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead, is that it can run the Mod DayZ.The bonus of running DayZ is that - you can play on multiple maps, and you can also play multiple mods.Not only do you have to put up with both the Zombies and the Players - with some DayZ servers, you also have to deal with AI. This makes it one of the best games I have played.The visual graphics aren't the best, however for one of the time period that this game came out in - it is actually quite decent.The atmosphere in the game varies depending on your situation.I would recommend this game if anyone wanted a survival action game to play with others.For those who do not know how to play DayZ:- Install and run Arma 2.- Install and run Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.- Download and install DayZ commander and then the mods/maps you wish to play.""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted December 24, 2013.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '221100', 'helpful': '7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': 'DayZ Standalone...If you liked the Mod for Arma 2, then you will love this.- Graphics are better, suitable for both low and high gaming computers.Everyone will be able to play, with no real advantage (such as low graphics over high)- Intense SurvivalThe survival between this version and the Mod, has increased ten-fold.Players will now have different blood types, meaning only certain types can be beneficial to you.As for now, thirst seems to be the main issue. Most ""cans"" of drink are counted as Hunger, not Thirst.- CustomizationThe customization within the game is amazing. Not only can you change the usual things - such as gender and skin colour.You can wear and replace the following; Headpiece, Eye-wear, Shirt, Trousers, Gloves, and Shoes.Besides the clothing customization - you can also find pieces to customize guns with, such as the stock, grip, scopes, etc.- OverallFor an Alpha...

This makes 1v1 beacon battles in a Long Range Frigate (sniper) almost impossible.some modules a way OP others totaly underpowered (eg the reload time on Gunship modules removing negative effects is way too long while other ships can pretty much immediately debuff your ship again)Gunships are also too slow in my opinion, while any interceptor can juggle any other ship with ease if a pilot knows what he is doing, making them sometimes impossible to hit.Also there is not a very good Help section in the game and the online Wiki is incomplete (not to mention half russian)This game has a crapton of content though, many different modi and a great gameplay.

Life Is Feudal is by far one of the BEST sandboxes ive ever played. Its got unique systems and mechanics for crafting, forging, cooking, alchemy and other things like terraforming and logging. ALL of which have their own skill sets and levelling so you won't progess skills the same way twice, or find the same items & ingredients in the same place which is a nice touch. Depending on which server you are on, there are also variable stat & skill caps this means that if you specialise in a certain skill it can determine how useful you will be in building settlments, and once reach the leveling limit of one skill, thats it Reach the stat and skill caps and leveling up will be a distant memory as they will become rare occurences. This means prople of different skills will have to work together and pool resources and skills, especially if a battle takes place in nearby settlements/towns and repairs have to be made quickly. For example, one person of your group/guild might be a master blacksmith, while another will be a master Logger, so choosing which skill to level completely is CRUCIAL.You basically start the game with nothing but food scraps and rags for clothes, so your first instinct is to create primitive gear which can be done quite quicker than you would expect. As you start to meet random people in your travels, you will also start to learn of the surrondings more and where developments have been started. I remember one time where I spawned into the world and I basically turned right and saw an ENTIRE FORTRESS built far off into the distance on the other side of an island, and as I explored around there was the odd camp/shack then a small town where groups have formed a guild. It cleary shows the sheer scope of how important working with people is in this game.Another strong point is the combat mechanics, if you have played the Mount & Blade games you will feel right at home here with the directional movements and there are even group formations to be used in a battle! Formations like shield walls, phalanx/wedge, and defensive circle formations can be applied and changed on the fly in mid battle, VERY useful for when 2 armies or more are battling it out.The final thing you will notice (and the most notable when you start the game and spawn into a world) is the graphics. At the moment there are Direct x 7 and 9 graphics, DO NOT let the discussions and reviews fool you! This game is a visual master piece considering the DX7 and 9 graphics closely resemble TES4: Oblivion's graphics, but with the fast approaching release date the Direct x 11 graphics will make this one of the most beautiful medieval themed sandboxes ever made!Overall i give this game a 8.5/10 and thats just at an EARLY ACEESS point of veiw as Bitbox are at the moment of smoothing everything out for the release and beginning to implement future features upon post release. This has been one of the most comprehensive, immersive and challenging games ive played to date. Looking forwand to more! 11/10 would recommend this game to those who have never played sandboxes or similar themed games like MMORPG's as it is worth the experience.""}]",['290080'],['2'],[True],1.0

Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be.

The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or ""pinned"" survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren\'t willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted October 17, 2015.', 'last_edited': '', 'item_id': '218620', 'helpful': '2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': 'On the brightside.

These can be tedious as well as you may need to grapple up a section ( which means jumping out of the Batmobile ), or jump over a section of land, and you\'re not sure where the next question mark is, or if you\'ve lost the trail and need to go back ) or downright frustrating ( one requires you destroy a bunch of riddler question marks in the Batmobile, but to do so you need to use missiles, or you\'ll run out of time and need to start the puzzle again. The catch? You need to be in combat to build up the meter to use them, meaning if you screw it up and need more energy to use the missiles, then you need to, tediously, drive around beating up bad-guys cars until you gather the minimum two bars of energy needed to beat the puzzle ). However, they are mercifully few- Not all of the gadgets are acquired via the story, some are literally just laying around, waiting for you to find them ( I\'m looking at you, remote electric charge )- A few of the Riddler trophies/riddles actually had me stumped, some riddles required you search around for a little room that exists only to hide the puzzle solution ( which I don\'t think is entirely fair, but then again, that\'s just my opinion )TECHNICAL:Pros:- The game does actually run at 25-30 fps averageCons:- You will likely need to turn off a bunch of the fancy graphics options and maybe lower the resolution ( I played it at 1024x768 with none of the fancy options on, and everything set to low. I enjoyed the game immensely, but I also understand not everyone is able to enjoy a game at 25-30 fps with all of the settings turned down/off )OVERALL:Pros:- Good Batman experience- Good ending to the series as a whole ( and, I daresay, a good ending for the Batman mythos )Cons:- There are technical issues; you may want to consider any updates that have been released since this review, as well as what people have been saying on the discussion board, before actually making the purchase'}]","['359310', '208650']","['2', '2']","[False, True]",0.5

Overview\t Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO or GO for short) is an online tactical and first-person shooter. The aim of the game depends on the game mode. Game modes consist of modes like Demolition and Hostage Rescue. Modes\t In Demolition, the Terrorists (T for short) have to plant a bomb at one of two sites, Site A or Site B. The Counter-Terrorists (CT for short) have to stop the Terrorists by erradicating the enemy team. Each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800, which they can buy other weapons and gear with. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons. The first to win 16 rounds wins.In Hostage Rescue, the Terrorists most ""protect"" the hostages from the Counter-Terrorists while the Counter-Terrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap. If either team erradicates the other, they win.In Casual, your rank is not affected by your wins/loses. Other modes, like surfing and ""Cas Team Deathmatch"" are in here.  Ranks\t   Catagory ScoreStatement   Gameplay 9Gameplay is fun and quick, however, it can get really intense at times, making it more fun!   Graphics 7Graphics are a plus for this addition to the Counter-Strike series. It is a very good looking game to play in.   Teamwork 9Teamwork is esential in this game, otherwise, the game is ruined.

Being one of those people, my initial reaction was to pirate this game, expecting something brief not worth my time. Instead, I found a thoroughly enjoyable experience that led me to actually buy the game and play through the levels I had so far completed again.I'll just say it now: I think it's worth buying Besiege for what it currently has to offer. a $7 price tag is insanely cheap for a game that I would expect to cost $15 or $20. While currently there are limited levels available, there really is an infite amount of time one can spend on them. If you simply rush through the game completing each level as fast as possible you'll likely be done in under 2 hours, dependant upon your proficiency.However, you'd be doing the game and yourself a great injustice. This game is not just about completing simple tasks. It's about completing them in the most wacky and roundabout ways you can imagine. You'll find yourself restarting levels to try new ideas, perhaps to beat your time or minimum amount of blocks used, or perhaps just to see if it'll work.Now that I've praised the game, here's what I don't like about it, keeping in mind these will probably all be solved in future updates.1. Lack of tutorialsWhile the game is relatively simple, there are no real tutorials to teach you what to do. If you're clever enough, you'll be able to figure out how to do basic functions by yourself (steering, flying, etc) and the game is all about building, testing, failing, building again. However, some basic tutorials to point players in the right direction could solve a lot of rage-quits.2. No multiplayerCome on developers, this is the obvious thing to do with the game. You add a multiplayer battle arena where you let people fight to the death with their machines, perhaps limiting their number of blocks or which blocks can be used. Maybe you could even add other multiplayer gamemodes, like races or castle sieges. To me this seems like the obvious direction to take the game in, because it'll be awesome and will encourage people to buy rather than pirate.3. The controlsThe controls for moving around the camera seem straightforward, yet somehow I always have trouble adjusting to them. I'm not sure why, everything works the way it should, but I always end up being far too zoomed out when trying to look at something from underneath.4. The lagThis is likely an inherent issue with the engine and not something easily fixable, but I thought it would be worth mentioning. I've got a pretty high end gaming pc, but on levels with a lot of enemies and a very large machine I do find the game to lag momentarily when I test my machine. Keep in mind I've only encountered this in specific scenarios and only for a few seconds before it settles.As you can see, these issues are all relatively minor and will likely be fixed in the future. Even if they weren't, I'd still recommend this game.

On top of that the game is actively being updated; with updates providing players with a hefty amount of new content. Multiplayer is good fun although I prefer the more easygoing experience of singleplayer. Like most games there are large public servers but you can easily make LAN and Private servers with the aid of programs such as LogMeIn Hamachi.

Dota 2 offers a pool of over 100 absolutely free heroes and both a casual and competitive approach. However you choose to play the game you'll be met with an array of toxic, cussing and hateful individuals who will trash talk and rage at you for the simplest mistake. A thick skin is necessary to obtain full enjoyment out of Dota 2. Ignoring the savage community, Dota 2 has perhaps the most engaging, entertaing and satisfying gameplay ever. It feels amazing to initiate a succesful teamfight or to just win a close game. Most heroes are balanced meaning most victories are owed to the skills of the players, however a keen sense of mechanics knowledge is mandatory due to the game's reliance on different damage types and various other integral factors. Whilst it can be difficult as a new player, persistence and resilience can introduce you to many hours of fun. For the best possible experience, playing with friends will both save you from hateful people and allow you to synergise your strategies.

If that isn't enough there is a thriving modding community on Skyrim nexus and the steam workshop. I've played Skyrim A LOT spanning over many different profiles and still to this day there is something new that surprises me. While Skyrim isn't as deep as RPGs go it is a world filled with emersive characters and storylines: the voice acting is top notch (they have Mario as part of the cast!) and the artwork on the city designs such as Windhelm is fantastic.

This game is set between Borderlands 1 and 2 and tells the tale of new Vault Hunters working for everyone's favourite charming psychopath Handsome Jack. The new Vault Hunters and the story of Handsome Jack's plight are top notch, however this game is plagued by a fair number of issues. Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap are a blast to play, which they owe to their unique action skills and distinct skill trees. The narrative is enjoyable if somewhat predictable and adds some depth to the demonised Handsome Jack. Now for the bad stuff, essentially this game can be viewed as a large mod for Borderlands 2 as it is built on the same engine. Additionally The Pre Sequel's end game is hampered by un-respawning bosses and an expansive list of unobtainable legendary gear. Many enjoyable boss battles can only be played once per playthrough and most of the legendaries can only be obtained via the grinder. Speaking of legendaries; most of these will be familiar from Borderlands 2, some at least have been renamed in the hopes that we won't notice. With recent patches failing to acknowledge key issues in the game unless you are a true Borderlands fan you won't find much reason to continue playing past playthrough number 1. All in all the Pre Sequel was thoroughly enjoyable on its first playthrough, the inclusion of Ocker Australian humor and the fantastic narrative provided enjoyment but the lack of end is sorely noticed.

The character designs and animations are gorgeous, they all look and feel different (unless we're talking about Filia and Fukua).

Zombies are not really a problem, i mean they glitched around nearly a year but hey, this problem got fixed. So, the issue that bothers me is the very, very slow development of the game after more then a year. On the start they showed us a pay-method where you could save money if you buy it as an early access game, so that they get funds and develop it faster (that it reaches beta). But after more then a year we are still in alpha. Mayor updates introduce items they promised nearly a year ago. (Seriously?)and fix bugs players had for over 1/2 a year. It develops way to slow for the starting hype, so there is no wonder they lose more and more players after a year.

Defend your town and cities with a well timed cavalry charge to disable enemy siege weapons and rain down flaming arrows upon the counter-attack.The ability to control each unit individually makes for practically unlimited strategy and the ability to destroy armies that on paper appear much stronger.The turn based city building side of the game also allows for a lot of strategic play, build advanced barracks, archery ranges and stables in castles, and increase revenue by upgrading towns to cities and so-forth.This mode can get a bit tedious in the later game simply because of the amount of organising necessary, but there are options to auto-manage these.Overall the balance between the slow pace of the city building mode and the fast real time battles is such that you can lose hours as your empire slowly gobbles up it's enemies and neighbouring factions.

I was home sick from work one day and was looking through my Steam list and decided to give it a go. The game has plenty of value, there\'s many hrs of gameplay in this title and although the controls feel odd & the graphics are a little dated you can tweak the dosbox config files to give you a little bit better picture.You move around using the arrow keys, with caps lock as toggle run, A as jump, E as use and I to open your inventory. To drink a potion you must press I to open inventroy then left click it so it\'s in your ""hand"" then press U on the keyboard to use it. Kind of crazy system but once you get used to it then it\'s alright.The combat is interesting because it has melee weapons as well as ranged, it can be hard to judge the melee range at times so I find it best to just stand back and spam the attack button until a hit collides then backpedal and keep swinging again.Similar to other games of the time there are a number of puzzles you must solve by finding items hidden throughout the area and then using them on a certain object to continue. Thankfully this version of the game has the update that enables ""easy puzzle mode"" which auto equips the correct item when attempting to use something so you don\'t have to madly try everything in your inventory on everything, this cuts down on much frustration and makes for an overall more enjoyable experience.The story is told through strange live action FMVs with terrible green screening, they look really bad by todays standards but the storyline is suitably cheesy that it just seems to work, I feel if the subject was more serious then the low quality would detract from it but I still found the FMVs enjoyable with their retro charm.I would definitely recommend this game although I must say I preface this by mentioning I got the game free from an indiegala giveaway so you may be able to find someone who doesn\'t want their code that you can get it free from.

For whatever reason the players are actually objects that block you and make it a major pain to navigate the maps.Missing basic functionality such as changing your FOV from the options menu.

The game only comes with one campaign which you can finish in a few hours but it is fun and as I said, there is a map editor so you can download many more off the Steam forums or other places.""}]","['350810', '224820', '292390', '250600', '225840', '630']","['1', '2', '2', '2', '0', '2']","[True, True, True, True, False, True]",0.8333333333333334

Soundtrack is out of this world, and the game is punishing, but not artificially difficult. If you die, it's your fault.Artifacts let you add modifiers to your game, such as Glass, which gives you a 500% damage boost, but only 10% of your regular health. This, in addition to numerous character classes and items, makes the game have a lot of replay value, with each run being slightly different. Until you get the Command artifact, that is.My favourite element of the game is the difficulty slider. You genuinely feel rushed, as every few minutes the game gets harder, to the point where in later levels you will find yourself facing randomly spawned bosses from the first few levels. Or maybe that's a bug. I don't actually know :P But playing can become a real hassle later on, where you basically have to get a good ratio of items to time spent, and move on.You will not beat this game on your first try. That is a given. It is ball-crushingly hard, but in a way where if you play enough, the game becomes much more simple.Unlocking stuff is fun. Items are fun. Characters are fun.This review is a bit all over the place, I know, but I'd give this game a solid 9/10.

You can choose out of 6 races (or 7 if you have dlc) and can the play on two different maps. You play with three different people and as you gain more experience you can make your character stronger by giving him armor, weapons, and traits and abilities.

So unless you are willing to invest a large amount of your time in this I would leave it alone.Starting to play this game I would start clicking on random body parts trying to kick the other guy in the face and eventually fall over onto the floor and flop around trying to get back up until I get disqualified because something other than my limbs brushed the floor like I was playing 'the floor is lava'. After I got the hang of it (to a degree) I started to pull of some cool moves and I did have a bit of fun with it. Even if I still kept falling over onto the floor.I also tried it out with my friends, which I have to say was a lot of fun. Most of the games ended up with us both on the floor swinging random body parts around in an attempt to hit eachother while trying not to get disqualified until it ended up like the least interesting game of twister ever. But in the end we had a good laugh.There are also a lot of mods (and I mean a lot) for this game, that can change it completely and make the game a bit more interesting. I won't go too much in detail about that though as there are too many mods to write a review on.This game is definately worth picking up especially for the fact that is free, it's definately a unique experience for the fighting genre and it equals for a good laugh with friends.8/10 :)""}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted February 14, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited August 20, 2014.', 'item_id': '236510', 'helpful': '1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': False, 'review': ""Don't get this.

Along with it's easy to use menu system, with simple but balanced ship customisation, it creates the type of game that is so easy to just start up, and get stuck into. Not only that but the modern arcade style visuals with dynamic feeling backgrounds and enemies makes it a very good sight for sore eyes.The feeling you get when you just beat your personal best, or absolutely dominate it by managing a score in the millions is nothing but pure acomplishment and satisfaction.

Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players.

The villiam has great writing, I can\'t press this enough, it\'s just so good!*THe humor is pretty good, whether you\'re climbing a nuke, or you\'re in a 60\'s sitcom, you\'ll get a laugh out of this game.*The graphics (on max settings) weren\'t improved by much, but they still look pretty good.*A bunch of the side mission/activities are extremely fun to play (fraud being my favourite)*optimisation is extremely good in the single player*There\'s a bunch of gun custimisation, you can make your pistols into robo cops gun!CONS-*Gunplay seems to be just an after thaught in this title, the game kind of expects you to just use your super powers, which is nice and all, but I like scoring 5 headshots in a row with robo cops gun. *While there is alot of gun custimisation, it all seems reduntant once you get super powers, which is a shame because there are some really cool skins for your guns (the pulse rifle, for example)*Just like guns, cars become obselete once you get your super powers, this is made worse by the fact that the new/improved car custimisation system is awesome! Unfortunately, the game basically punishes you for using cars.*Like many people, I believe the game gives you super powers far too early. If they had given them to you perhaps half way through the game, this would help with the redundancy of the cars/guns.*co-op is LAGGY!!!! It\'s seriously un playable at times, if you want this game for co-op, you have been warned.MIDDLE-*They basically re used the same map from saints 3, and added a few things here and there. I don\'t really hate that, I mainly just thought ""after you guys decided this would be a full game, couldn\'t you at least give us a new map to run around in??""VERDICT--Saints row 4 is a worthy addition to the saints row franchise, it has great humor, addicting gameplay amongst all the other great things about this game. There are a few problems, but they don\'t really take away from the experience or the fun to be had here. Unfortunately, this is basically the last game in the franchise, I suppose it\'s good it ended on a good note then!I would definately reccomend this (I don\'t use a number system because it\'s flawed)'}]","['55230', '220760', '208580', '354500', '6880', '24240', '206420']","['2', '0', '2', '2', '0', '2', '2']","[False, True, True, True, True, True, True]",0.8571428571428571

This also allows you to use resources early in buildings tech, and then recycle it when a better option arrives, meaning that a player who can manage his resources well will do better than one who just holds onto resources until a ""top tier"" usage for them is unlocked.-massive maps are possible, so with the right settings it doesnt feel like a ""small"" galaxy or that you\'re running out of space (until late game)-starbases used intelligently can give an edge at all points in the game, especially economic starbases. eg rather than waste a building slot on your planet to raise approval, just get the approval upgrade on the starbase linked to the planet.-able to finely control research/economy output/dedication on planets individually, but also with the ""govern"" tab you can do this en mass, saving time. Same applys for upgrading ships, etc.-every planet has an event, which some may find annoying, but I think is good, allows you do add a slight layer of uniqueness to each planet as well as develop your ideology.-its actually more beneficial long terms to dabble in all ideologies to some extent, as long as your primary ideology has most points you wont have an ideological shift. This means you dont have to do the unrealistic option (as in some games with ideologies/religions) and devote 100% to an ideology. This also means, if desired, you can play on the basis of the moral choices involved for events/planets and still do OK in terms of ideological benefit (as opposed to number crunching the statistical/numerical benefits for each choice planet, etc)Cons- diplomacy at first seems well developed, but that\'s only for early game. Late game diplomacy is at best, shallow, at worst, buggy. ""Benevolent"" ideologies seem to hate pragmatic ideologies as much as ""malevolent"" ideologies, which is silly and means that as a pragmatist, you need to kill anyone else who isn\'t a pragmatist and can only really form alliances with other pragmatists. This makes a diplomacy victory in a large game close to impossible without a decent military (because you need to kill anyone who refuses to ally with you), which means its always going to be predominantly a conquest based game.--continuing on for diplomacy: enemies will gladly colonise planets within starsystems you have partially colonized and there\'s no warning to tell them to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off (as in games like CIV 5), and the same for resources. Early game is basically en-mass resource grab if you dont want to be screwed over mid/late game.-pirates/barbarians in 4X games are normally some kind of great equalizer early game to prevent a military/expansion snowball (eg sins of a solar empire, civ, etc), but in this game they\'re just annoying and dont do much besides kill the occasional scout. also, AI dont appear to be bothered by pirates, so its just a player handicap.-once you start going balls to the walls crazy large military, the game will start glitching out your ""military power"" parameter, which means for the purposes of diplomacy, one turn later everyone will think you\'re the weakest, declare war/‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with you even though you could wipe them out. this also contributes to the impossiblity of a diplomacy victory (without killing loads of people) -terraforming in the incorrect order can cost you between 1-3 tiles per planet, which is a fair amount. eg if you use a higher grade terraformer on a ""easy"" tile, you wont be able to terraform the ""harder"" tiles, as late game you can terraform as many ""easy"" tiles as you like, meaning its better long term to hold off on terraforming until you\'ve researched it fully as it isnt always clear which tiles are ""easy"" or ""hard"".-money is weak, it can take anywhere between 5-15 turns to be able to afford to rush construction (pretty much the only use of money, besides upgrading your military ships) whereas focusing on manufacturing allows you to build anything in 1-3 turns. Basically as long as you break even with your economy, you can just focus on manufacturing and research. Its actually usually better to just decommission old ships and build news ones rather than upgrade them (which will make you bankrupt quick if you have a large army)---In other words with the diplomacy + economy balancing, there is no viable economy based strategy or peaceful based strategy. No matter what, you will always need the strongest military regardless of your intended method of victory (unlike some other 4X games, where you could have an adequate military and with good diplomacy/economy still obtain most victory types you desire). And basically to get the strongest military you need to focus on research and manufacturing.- united galaxies is but a shallow addition to the game, furthermore, if someone ever defies (which is almost always), they are permanently booted, which can lead to the ridiculous situation of having a united galaxy meeting of 2 members, while the other 6-10 races are ""defiant"" (yet have not formed another united galaxies).meh features:-culture. you must have decent culture to stop other races culture from ""flipping"" your planets, it also creates territorial space and (I think) it allows your ships to fly further into enemy space. problem is that if your culture is too strong it flips the planets of other races, including that of your allies. this makes your allies weaker and it entirely possible for them to be wiped off the map (further adding to the difficulty of a diplomacy victory). It also may land you a bunch of crap planets that you dont want to deal with. Fortunately you can give the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• planets to the minor races (who are immune to culture flipping)note: most of these issues dont apply to multiplayer games, this is predominantly a critique of single player. although culture flipping feature will suck when playing co-op with friends.Do I regret buying the game at full price? a bitam I enjoying the game? yesshould you buy this game full price? only if you plan to win/enjoy by conquest every time or if you only care about multiplayershould you buy this game on discount? yes, if it were at 25% discount it would be a good priceit should be noted that stardock have a good trackrecord for improving/patching their games post release, so I anticipate that some of these issues I have raised will be gone in the future.'}, {'funny': '', 'posted': 'Posted November 12, 2014.', 'last_edited': 'Last edited November 13, 2014.', 'item_id': '294860', 'helpful': '2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful', 'recommend': True, 'review': '10/10EDIT: After playing the game from the while its clear that the translation takes quite a few liberties overall plot is the same, but it does change the tone of a few interactions and scenes.

Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen.

I have bought all of their DLCs (Even the Completely Overkill Pack) so that i could support OVERKILL and help them bring new content to this game. But the new Weapon rebalance and Black market update have destroyed all faith i had in OVERKILL. If you have played CS: GO or have seen crate openings, it‚Äôs exactly the same thing. When you complete a heist, you may earn a safe that can only be opened by purchasing a drill. When you open the safe, you'll earn a random weapon skin with a random condition ranging from Broken-in (Battle Scarred) to Mint-Condition (Factory New). This would be alright, if it wasn't for one detail. Weapon skins can give you stat buffs. That‚Äôs right, a cosmetic actually improves the killing power of the weapon. It might improve accuracy, stability or total ammo, pretty much any stat. Who thought this was a good idea? This is a Pay to Win Mechanic. And the weapon rebalance has destroyed the weapons, either making a weapon extremely under powered or over powered. Revolvers do more damage than some sniper rifles, a DMR does more damage than a sniper, all shotguns except for double barrelled shotguns were nerfed to oblivion and most pistols are one shotting enemies on the highest difficulty. These changes have rendered the game completely unplayable and i will not be returning to Payday 2 until these issues have been fixed. (I should also mention a humorous bug that is currently in the game. The Minigun used to give a movement penalty and had mods that would reduce the movement penalty. They removed the Minigun movement penalty but not the mods ability to increase speed, meaning with both speed increasing mods for the Minigun, you run faster with it equipped than any other weapon)""}]",['218620'],['2'],[False],0.0

It runs surprisingly well, despite having so much going on at any given time and doesn't lag my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• little laptop to crap. The only complaint I have is that the clicking seems to be a bit buggy (which might just be my mouse) but there seems to be a delay between the times you can actually click. Which sucks when you're trying to rapid bite when you're being swarmed by enemies and you bite really slowly OR not at all. The other complaint I have is that it wipes your coins every time you quit, so you *have* to start over. I collected over 200 coins when I first played and when I logged back in they were gone and I was kinda mad lol.

The game reminds me of a mix of Shelter 2 and Wolfquest, both games I personally really enjoy. The biggest problem I have with the game by far is the camera controls, I've never liked fixed cameras in games, so I like that you can toggle it, but the free-cam mode is just a little too wonky. I love the idea of mating with multiple males, though because in nature, all cats species, including cougars are very promiscuous and will mate with multiple males. I'm not sure if they are, because I haven't gotten that far into the game, but I'd like to see male cougars also being a threat to your cubs.

I still haven\'t finished the main quest, but it\'s already engaged me in a way that no other Bethesda game hasUnfortunately Fallout 4 still has a lot of the issues other Bethesda titles have suffered from like bugginess, random crashes, frame rate drops, insufficient tutorialisation, and moments of bad writing and/or voice acting. The good news is that all the stuff Bethesda are great at like character customisation and progression, world building, and of course the construction of hundreds if not thousands of mininarratives across the world have all been done exceptionally well here.The settlement system is fun but could certainly have used more attention. There\'s very little explanation of how it works and some obvious and painful limitations to it (which of course make me all the more eager for the creation kit\'s release). The stringent no-clipping rules are a pain, as is being unable to turn off automatic snapping, and time and again I find myself wanting to build objects which exist everywhere in the wasteland but can\'t be built in settlements (campfires for instance).Bethesda needs to improve in not releasing broken unpolished games, but in playing it I\'ve found it hard to point out situations where cutting a feature, location, quest, etc and spending the equivalent resources on bugtesting would result in a better game.Edit: Probably should have mentioned, I\'m not a fan of the dialogue system\'s ""press right to be an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, press down to be that kid in class who sucked up to the teacher, press left for wildcard? usually a sarcastic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• though.""

All this is perfectly paced, combining intense combat with a spattering of puzzles (which arent detrimental to the gameplay in the slightest), and no section feels drawn out or overly tedious. The musical score builds tension between battles, and a contributes to their intensity when they occur, resulting in an atmospheric experience. Enemy design is brillaint, with hordes of infected villagers, chainsaw wielding maniacs, and head-eating parasites (amongst many others), providing a unique gameplay experience based on thier varied traits, anilites, and the like. Finally, the weapon selection and ammunition distribution is one of the best things about it. At times, it is a genuhne conundrum over which weapon is better, and what to upgrade and when. No weapon (aside the uber expensive reward weapons for completing the game on the hardest difficulty) feel overpowered, and there is never a time at which one has enough ammunition to go on a blind rampage. The only negative I can produce for this particular version of the game is that the initial release has a few bugs, which are fast dissapearing thanks to Capcom's input.  Also it is advisable not to expect the graphics to live up to the hype. It is a 2005 game after all.

If anything, check out the mods, at least they are free, and just generally better. Epoch is quite good as you get fairly solid base building tools, vehicle modifications and random missions against bandits, mad scientists, heroes, and treasure hunters. Even with the best of PCs this game runs horribly. It's hard enough trying to survive in this game without your frame rate dropping to the point where you can't even aim to kill a zombie or player who is trying to kill you. Add to that the insane amount of cheaters and combat loggers and it is basically a death match, with random chances to die for no reason being extremely common (e.g. stand up in a house, die because the floor breaks your legs). Also, logging in and finding that a really nice piece of clothing or bullet proof vest you have has somehow become ruined (and thus damaging all of the gear in the clothing inventory slots) is common, and really frustrating. RIP plate carrier vest with gun pouch and Gorka military pants/jacket. May 2015 - May 2015, I crie evrytiem.I can't fathom why this game is priced so highly for early access, not when full release indie games (which can offer a much better experience) are usually lower in price. Elements that have been fixed for a long time in the mod (helicopter crashes, persistence, lack of loot) are suddenly broken in the standalone. Even new elements introduced into the standalone are broken later when something else is changed.This game might be more worthwhile when it is finished, but in its current state it is really not worth it. Avoid.
